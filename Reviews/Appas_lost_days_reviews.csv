Review: Nothing has made me more sad than seeing Appa hunched inside the boar's den when Suki approached him :(
"Review: I just realized that the little kid's dad at the circus tells him ""Behave yourself, or you'll regret it"" just like the beast-master tells Appa.

The parallel there, in my mind, pretty much confirms that that kid is probably abused by his dad too, which is why he feels so much sympathy for Appa. You know, just in case this episode needed even more depressive concepts sprinkled on top."
"Review: First timer here.

* Such as a sad episode. Appa didn't deserve any of this. Still, I applaud this show for conveying their story without forgoing any of the bad moments.
* Woah, that's a [giant beetle](https://i.imgur.com/Lq93OkU.png)! The array of giant beasts humans have been able to ""tame"" in this universe is intriguing.
* Was that the same circus in which Ty Lee performed earlier? The circus master looked familiar.
* Oh cmon, don't leave us hanging about the outcome of the Kyoshi warriors vs Azula. They seemed to be pretty much beat, but did they manage to come out of it safely?
* [Few ships with water-tribe members](https://i.imgur.com/LrZvPLs.png), was this the ~~Northern~~ Southern water-tribe navy?
* Guru Pathik seemed like an interesting character to me. What connection does he have with the Avatar? Is it because he is a spiritual person? I hope we see him again sometime.
* So close yet still not there, I wonder what Long Feng really wants with Appa. Does he have something in mind for Appa specifically, or does he want to manipulate the Avatar using Appa?"
"Review: This is the episode I find myself often skipping, more than the great divide.  
It's not that I don't like this episode, I find it hard to see Appa hurt and scared."
"Review: I think I’m just gonna skip this episode. Don’t want to see Appa get hurt so much again. 

From what I remember though, seeing the Kyoshi Warriors again was nice."
"Review: My heart hurts every time I watch this episode.

Appa gnawing on the teething bar always gets me :("
"Review: Newcomer on her second rewatch: During my first watch ( which was last week) starting with Episode 10, this run of episodes leading up to the conclusion of Book 2 gave me so much anxiety, I actually lost sleep over wondering what would happen to Appa and wondering when Aang would finally get him back. 

I'm re-watching the show with my kids and I'm worried/curious about how Tales of Ba Sing Se and Appa's Lost Days will affect them. I imagine at least two out of the three will be crying before it's all said and done."
Review: I think what always gets me is Appa remembering Aang when he sees that fire nation boy laughing. Kids like him were the light of the fire nation.
"Review: I realized while watching that Appa’s lost days is his extended tale of Ba Sing Se (because everyone else got one last episode except him). This episode is stellar as it conveys Appa’s emotions and story with little to know words. The music of avatar is normally amazing but this episode is on another level. 

Couple small things I noticed while rewatching:
-My heart broke when I saw how close Aang was to Appa, especially after Appa was darted. Shirsu venom only paralyzes, which means that Appa could continue to hear Aang after he was hit but couldn’t do anything about it

-Lots of great references to other episodes: the umbrella from Aunt Wu in the desert, a shirsu reference reminding us of June and Nyla, Ty Lee’s circus, Zuko’s hunt for the avatar last season, Guru Pathik’s lines that reference the swamp, and of course all the episodes previous that Appa’s been missing in

-The flashback to when Aang and Appa meet gets me every time, especially given that Aang at that point was trying to suppress his feelings. I can’t imagine what it would feel like to wake up the next morning from that good dream and go through the pain of losing appa all over again as he realized he was still missing. 

-Suki leaves an apple very similar to the one aang once gave him. A gesture of friendship. I wonder if appa thought of him while he ate it. >!I bet Appa remembered and greeted Suki in the same way he did Zuko!<

>!-I’d never put two and two together but Appa flys right over Hakoda and the southern water tribe. Based on Hakoda’s expression, its pretty clear to me he’s thinking if his kids are up there and if they’re okay.!<

->!Appa returning home and finding it to not be what he remembered is very similar to Zuko in book 3!<

->!Guru Pathik hits the chakra points when he’s looking at Appa!<

->!Appa’s hatred for the underground grows here and is the reason he didn’t want to leave the western air temple via a tunnel!<

>!Heartbreaking thought: Did Aang and Zuko ever firebend too close to Appa and freak him out?!<"
Review: This is the only episode that I allowed my fiancée to skip when we did our Netflix binge. She started getting worried and emotional when Appa got separated from the group in the **Swamp episode**.
"Review: I cried during this episode. I’m tearing up just thinking about that forest scene when he leaves Suki knowing he cannot help. Appa reminds me of my dog, snores like a lawnmower and has a dorky face. 

I do like how they devoted an episode to Appa’s character. I feel like most shows would have just dismissed any development for an animal."
"Review: This episode was so frustrating and sad. FFS I hope the Sandbender, the Clown and Long Feng rot in the pits of hell for what they did to my boy. Also, shoutout to the kid that fed Appa the haystack in the circus, he’s an angel"
Review: I feel like Ty Lee. I just got the fan girl joke. Good one Azula. Didn't get that the first time. This episode sealed Suki's fate as one of my favorite characters. Although those apples will not be enough for Appa's multiple stomachs. I realize watching this that Appa probably has ptsd and grief because he has no other sky bison like he once did. Poor Momo would've seen Appa had he stayed with the panthers. Also what was Appa so excited about seeing at the end?
Review: Thought this episode was called Appa's *Last* Days when I was a kid. Bawled my eyes out when he fought the boarcupine cause I thought he was gonna die lol.
"Review: First time watcher.

This is my least favorite episode so far (i'm only half joking). I was not emotionally or mentally prepared to see Appa abused, lonely, and afraid for 20 minutes."
"Review: Like some other folks mentioned, I seriously considered skipping this episode in the rewatch because watching it the first time was too painful. 

In addition to being heart-wrenching, this episode was the first to make me realize how important Appa is - he's not simply a beast of burden, but a *character* integral to the Gaang. I hadn't really realized the depth of his spiritual and emotional connection to Aang before the rewatch, but this episode did an excellent job of portraying that, his inherently good nature, and his determination. 

Also, the line about ""fear has moved in where trust used to be"" breaks me. Not only because Appa's sweet character is now damaged by all the hurt he's been put through, but because that line speaks volumes to victims of abuse."
Review: This is kinda off topic but it just hit me that it’s 2020 and I’m participating in daily discussions about a show I watched 15 (!) years ago. 9 year old me would honestly be so happy
"Review: The scene that always gets me is Appa dreaming of when him and Aang met, causing him to go back to the Air Temple in search of him because as Aang voice said “we’ll be together forever”. It’s sad. Thankfully he found the guru himself who led him back to Aang."
"Review: Truly the highlight of this episode for me is when Appa meets the Guru Pathik. It is devastating to see him assess all the emotional and spiritual damage Appa has been through (on top of his physical damage) . Yet, I am so glad Guru Pathik can provide some healing and safety for Appa in their short time together. 

When Guru Pathik says that Appa and Aang have an unbreakable bond because their energies are mixed, I can't help but feel the hurt they both must be going through this whole time being apart. The love between them is unbreakable even through this separation."
Review: First timer. I don't think I needed to know how close Appa was to returning to Aang. Seeing him hear the whistle broke my heart.
"Review: When Appa enters Ba Sing Se, there’s a shot of the black cats that see him come in. Eventually they lead mono to his footprint."
"Review: Watching this and ""The Tales of Ba Sing Se"" back to back makes me tearbend every time."
Review: THIS IS THE SADDEST EPISODE EVER POOR APPA
"Review: It’s so heartbreaking how Appa makes it all the way to the city, then gets kidnapped again by Long Feng"
"Review: Personally the arc with Appa is one of my favorite things in the show so I’m a little biased, but this is one of the best episodes in the whole series IMO. From the lowest of lows back up to a place where Appa (and the viewer) has hope again, it’s an incredible ride. 

A few little things I also enjoyed:

How careful and considerate Suki is when she first finds him. This episode cemented her as one of my favorite characters.

Guru Pathik asking permission to put the note on Appa’s horn. A small detail, but it speaks volumes about his character.

The “oh COME ON” that you have when Azula’s blue fire first appears. As soon as something finally goes right for Appa, it all goes wrong again :(

Suki scaring him away with the torch. So sad, even though she was ultimately helping him."
"Review: Ah yeah, the episode that takes your feelings and proceeds to destroy them mercilessly."
Review: Saddest episode ever... and I feel bad for the Kyoshi Warriors when they risked their life’s essentially for Appa.
"Review: This episode broke me seeing Aang lose his best friend and one of the last connections to his people was heart wrenching. Then to see that beautiful moment between Aang and Katara at the end, where Katara put her own safety at risk when she knew Aang was in his Most volatile state where she knew she could easily be hurt to love and comfort Aang was so nice."
"Review: I'm a bit conflicted about this episode personally. Most of the episode serves to set the stage for events in later episodes, most notably introducing the Guru. Other future plot points it sets up are a lot more spoilery so I'll leave it at that. Ultimately this episode  succeeds in its main mission.

There are a few other highlights. Its really cool (not sure if that's the best word choice) to see the events of _The Desert_ from Appa's perspective. We find out that he is responsible for Aang & co finding a buried sandglider in that episode, and much as _The Tale of Momo_ fleshes out Momo as a character in his own right beyond just 'the group pet', this episode establishes Appa as a character beyond just 'the unusually fuzzy aircraft'

However, at other points, the episode is a lot weaker. Besides being hard to watch, the whole first half of the episode with Appa being abused in the circus doesn't have any significant bearing on later events. >!Even his fear of fire, which you'd think is the whole point of the bison abuse sequence, is never really mentioned again for the rest of the series!< It thus ends up being much more hollow than the other comparatively gut-wrenching moments in the show."
Review: I loved the end with the time passing by of Appa’s interaction with Guru. I don’t think Appa would’ve recovered if the guru wasn’t there. It was also perfect and showed that we don’t always need words to process emotions in good shows like Avatar
"Review: The most emotional episode out of the whole bunch. Appa goes through so much ever since the kidnapping and all he gets is to get trapped underneath the floor.

my heart man 💔"
"Review: I’m aware this is an unpopular opinion on this subreddit, but I don’t really rate this episode. I really didn’t like it when I was younger, I have a short attention span and the lack of dialogue just meant I kept getting distracted. I watched it properly recently and I enjoyed it more, but it isn’t one of my favourites."
"Review: Makes me cry every time. I seriously almost skipped this episode during my latest rewatch; animal abuse is an issue that is very near and dear to my heart, and this episode was almost too upsetting to me"
Review: Appasode
"Review: Now that I think about it, how did Appa know Aang was in Ba Sing Se and how to get there?  Was Guru Pathik able to impart that knowledge? Wait, how did HE know where Aang was?"
"Review: I just watched this episode again for the first time since childhood. Oh my god. My friends and loved ones know me to be over the top, emotional, and dramatic, but even my boyfriend was surprised by how hard I was full-body sobbing. I was surprised by how much it affected me. It just kept getting worse and worse as the episode went on."
Review: Does anyone know where to find the soundtrack to this episode? I've been searching but can't find it.
Review: This episode will always have a special place in my heart just like Appa
"Review: It takes *a lot* for a show to make me tear up, but I'm not even mad that this episode did it.

Also, even though I haven't watched this since I was a kid, I remembered every moment of this episode more clearly than any other one so far, especially that part with Appa's bedhead."
"Review: That ending hit hard:(

Well, the whole episode did tbh, poor Appa"
Review: First watcher here. I got the impression this is the first (if not the only) episode where we see actual blood coming out from a character's wound. And it's Appa's.
Review: I couldnt even control my crying lol. Once he went back to the western temple i bawled and couldnt even see what happened next. Ive seen it twice before when I was younger but I dont remember this episode at all.. I wasnt ready to be heartbroken lol
"Review: I know I am super late but man this episode wrecks me, just absolutely gutted. Even thinking about it makes me tear up a bit. Poor Appa the animators did such an incredible job on him here, the emotions were so palpable."
Review: I’m fucking crying
Review: Did anyone else catch how sokka's club was left behind in the desert with the saddle and the gaang's other belongings?
Review: i dont wanna watch the episodes where they lose appa and seeing this episode. im skipping cause i dont wanna cry
"Review: [Appa's Lost Days](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/lb_i.php?lb_id=13083663820B12460100&i_id=13118379920I86180600&p=37) - Don't really have much to say about this one tbh, my point remains the same regarding what I said about the previous episode and what I suggested [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/h9ai9s/comment/fux4wbl?context=1) in this discussion I had. So yeah, good episode, bad timing. 

Oh, and fuck Guru >!Yoda!<, ~~er I mean Plot Device, no I mean~~ Pathik, for reasons you will learn later rather than sooner."
Review: I didn't like how Appa was abused at the circus. Especially when they made him a clown.
Review: This damn episode always makes me cry.
"Review: Yeah, as much as I hate to see Appa suffering physical pain, the thing that hurts me most of all about this episode is how we see Appa's innately trusting, good nature repeatedly betrayed and abused, gradually causing him to become more and more defensive and scared with each new encounter. It's so sad watching the loving, gentle giant being forced to fear the world all of a sudden."
"Review: But Suki handles it **so** well.  She doesn’t push, she leaves food and comes back with help.  She makes sure everyone knows what’s going on and always prioritizes Appa’s well-being.  

That moment is what cemented my appreciation of Suki."
"Review: I guess the good news in all of this is that the kid got to see Appa break away from his chains and fly out of the tent. They share a look right before he does, too, so that kid probably has hope now that one day he can break free and fly out of his “tent,” too."
"Review: That kid is voiced by Aang's voice actor, which makes it sadder too, because Appa is probably reminded of Aang :("
"Review: I never realized this till the rewatch! I almost thought this line was supposed to give insight to the Fire Nation culture of parenting/emphasis on domination and order, in addition to implying abuse."
"Review: Great questions! Unfortunately, I can’t answer any of them without revealing spoilers. Only thing I can tell you is that yes, the circus Appa is forced into is the same circus Ty Lee performed at."
"Review: Can I just say how much I appreciate you doing this. I watched the show before I could remember and rewatched it with my brother dozens of times when I was a child. Ever since it is on Netflix I can enjoy the show, but I already know how it end, without knowing how I felt watching the show for the first time. This is the closest I can get to experience going through this story for the first time.
Thanks to you!"
"Review: The water tribe ships were Southern, the last time we saw them was in ""Bato of the Water Tribe"" in season 1 I think."
Review: You will get answers to your questions in due time
Review: Guru patik is a master schlongbender
Review: Seeing Appa develop that fear of people and especially fire was absolutely heartbreaking. It was so sad that Suki had to use that fear against him to send him away near the end too.
Review: Nice for a second until they are bested by azula
Review: He’s just a big baby :( probably the same maturity age as Aang just a different temperament.
"Review: Its such a good way for kids to discover these kinds of emotions, i think. The show truly is a masterpiece in TV making, but especially a masterpiece in children's TV. It often gets praised as ""still so good for adults"" that I feel it doesnt get recognised enough that it is absolutely great for kids"
Review: Fun fact: the fire nation boy is voiced by the same VA who voices Aang! It's a sweet detail for how much Appa misses him during their separation.
"Review: On your second to last point I believe Appa’s hatred for being underground grew from being trapped in the Cave of Two Lovers, not from this episode."
Review: Usename checks out. If she has a chance of like a dangerous panic attack then I agree but man I never resonated with Appa and hearing other people’s experiences with this episode makes me feel like I really missed out on something.
Review: I agree
"Review: >	I feel like Ty Lee. I just got the fan girl joke.

I’ve had to watch this episode more times than I can count before I got the joke. I can’t believe I missed it for so long."
Review: He didn't see anything. He was being triggered by the Dai Li's bison whistles
Review: [deleted]
"Review: ATLA does a great job of making sure Appa is an actual character, not just a pet. It’s really beautiful"
Review: That's what I love about Reddit. You can find communities for old series and discuss episodes as if they premiered today
Review: Same here. I'm loving it.
Review: Bruh I was the same age when this came out and I basically forgot the entire show since it aired.
"Review: > It thus ends up being much more hollow than the other comparatively gut-wrenching moments in the show.

Hmm, I'm not sure ""hollow"" is the word I'd use. ""Meaningless"" seems more apt, and while it *is* essentially meaningless from a narrative perspective, I rather think that's the point. Violence and abuse towards animals often *is* meaningless and senseless. Not every act of cruelty or injustice exists to teach someone something or serve a concrete purpose. Sometimes people are just cruel for the sake of cruelty, especially towards ""mindless beasts"" who can't properly defend themselves or call out the person abusing them.

Bearing in mind that this show *is* still aimed primarily at children, I think the main point is just to show that animals can go through great suffering too, and that a lot of people don't really give that suffering as much consideration as they should, precisely because it's happening to animals and not people. Considering this episode received a Genesis Award for its portrayal of the animal cruelty that often takes place behind the scenes in circuses, I think it achieved exactly what it set out to achieve."
"Review: I dont think so, I've made a comment higher up in the thread explaining that its a amazing series eat, but its especially a great kids series, especially in how it teaches emotions to kids. I think the part that seems meaningless to us maybe, is great for kids to explore bad emotions in a safe environment. What fairy tales used to do, can now additionally be done by this new medium, and avatar is a grade A example of how to do it."
"Review: I mean, that makes sense, iirc it's the same reason why theres a narrator in Spirit. This ep is more for the older kids, than the younger ones."
Review: I'm genuinely curious what your issue with Guru Pathik is.
Review: I think that this episode arrives at the perfect moment. We have been long enough without Appa and this episode makes his reunion with Aang and the Gaang as a whole more heartwarming. We gain a greater understanding of how huge is the bond of Aang and Appa specially
Review: Oh fuck.. I'm not crying you are
Review: It makes it even sadder that suki kinda has to betray him again for his own safety
Review: Suki is so underappreciated!
"Review: In an episode full of heartbreaking moments, this one destroyed me. I'd already had to pause the show after the kid interacts with Appa the first time cause I was crying too hard (and I 100% agree with the first commenter that the show is drawing a clear parallel between these two characters' situations - that mirrored dialogue is too obvious to not be intentional), but then the little boy tells Appa that he can do it and that he believes in him and I just lose it. I can't watch that kid cheer on Appa without considering what it must mean to him to see Appa escape. On the one hand it's, as you said, a beautiful moment of hope. On the other, there's the harsh reality that this kid isn't breaking free anytime soon and is gonna have to hold onto that hope through years of abuse. By the end of the scene, I was full on ugly crying bawling my eyes out."
"Review: Appa is reminded of Aang! There is a scene where the kid is laughing and it reminds Appa of Aang, to the point where he breaks out of the circus."
"Review: I'm very happy to hear people enjoy reading these!

I've always liked to discuss shows while watching them, and the ATLA community has been great at granting my wish. Makes the quarantine just a bit more tolerable. :)"
"Review: Whoops, I did mean the Southern tribe. Thanks for the correction."
"Review: ""Aang, I will teach you how to master your schlong state."""
"Review: yeah that makes sense, they even look familiar. now I'm in my feels again"
"Review: I agree that it totally started there (hence why I use the word grows), but >!I think getting chained up and left underground by the Dai Li definitely played into his hatred of it!<"
Review: Appa is basically the R2D2 of the avatar universe. He does so much and the group would be screwed without him but he doesn’t get very much credit.
"Review: I wonder how they got bison whistles. Come to think of it, it's weird Aang found one considering the species is thought to be extinct."
"Review: You are correct, but they do see Appa flying right before he is captured."
"Review: > Hmm, I'm not sure ""hollow"" is the word I'd use. ""Meaningless"" seems more apt, and while it is essentially meaningless from a narrative perspective, I rather think that's the point.

I think there is some meaning to it, as well, but perhaps not in the strict, narrative sense. Guru Pathik tells Appa that he and Aang are connected spiritually. Because of this connection, we can see another parallel: Both are afraid of fire. Aang himself feels so much regret and shame for burning Katara months ago for lacking restraint that it consumes him. However, >!our friend, the guru, later helps Aang reckon with the reality that he is the Avatar and therefore a firebender. Perhaps it is getting over that hump that helps Appa, too?!<

>!e: In fact, Aang's bison burp kind of builds on this idea a little more…!<"
Review: Yeah that makes a lot of sense. I would have been 6 at the time so I can see why the episode didn't have the emotional impact on me that it does on older viewers.
"Review: You will soon, but it's not really something that will Wow you tbh."
Review: 3 years late but just wanted to let you know I'm specifically seeking out the 2020 rewatch threads because of how much I enjoy your view as a first timer!
Review: [deleted]
"Review: Since the Guru is already being talked about here, there is only one issue that I have with him, only one possible criticism against him that I can see in my opinion: >!it's about how he explains the last chakra. Guru Pathik should have explained better what the last chakra was about, that it was only about learning and recognizing the duty to the world and appreciate the big universe as a whole in which everything else becomes insignificant. It's surely not about truly stop caring or loving your friends, just about a bigger cosmical perspective. It's my interpretation. But instead of explaining to Aang something in the line of this, Pathik only repeats to Aang over and over that he must let Katara go! How was Aang supposed to understand, much less accept, this? I wouldn't too.!<

Did I correctly guess your criticism against him? Besides, the Guru is so great and enlighting otherwise in the vast majority of his screen time that I really can't understand how it is possible to truly hate him. The criticism that I talked about is far from enough in my opinion."
"Review: Sorry, should have clarified. I watched the show when it first aired, so if you want to provide a spoiler tagged comment, that’ll work."
"Review: Thank you! Reading these replies always brings a smile to my face. I never expected the community's response to be so warm, and my comments here is the only reason I didn't delete my account when the API debacle happened."
"Review: I always understood it to mean that it was a sort of a makeshift whistle that still achieved the same purpose. Aang was drawn to buy his whistle initially because it had the shape of a sky bison, but as had been shown in Aang's Tales of Ba Sing Se episode, the high frequency emitted by his whistle (and any other similar whistle) was enough to attract all sorts of animals (since a lot of animals have their ears tuned to hear higher frequencies better, just like dogs)"
"Review: Spot on. It's that, and more."
"Review: Tempting, but nah, you'll have to wait late into season 3, >!Nightmares and Daydreams specifically!<"
"Review: Yo fr, After I watch each episode, I need to hear your perspective on it xD such an apt analysis and love that you even put hyperlink stuff. Appreciate it !"
"Review: Almost a year later, i always look for your comment when reading these discussions"
Review: I’m watching for the first time right now so it’s great to see someone else’s matching perspective instead of all the rewatches!
"Review: Wait, are you just referring to >!Aang’s daydream/hallucination when the guru comes in singing about chakras???!< If so, your earlier comment was way too vague to figure that out."
"Review: I'd hoped to make my perspective more interactive with the images, glad you like it!"
Review: That's very kind! I never thought my comments would be interesting to read years down the line when I wrote them.
Review: I'm happy to see people relate to my experience watching ATLA for the first time. Sometimes I even come back myself to read my original perspective!
"Review: Not specifically that, no."
"Review: Then dude, what the heck are you talking about? You say to wait until that season 3 episode, but I watched it 2 days ago and doesn’t tell me anything. What are you on about?"
"Review: Not discrediting the emotional weight  of this episode, but for me The Desert hit me harder. When Aang finds out Gashuin and the sand benders muzzled Appa and he goes into the avatar state, it’s almost instant tears for me. Not to mention when Aang and Appa reunite and Aang hugs him. 

But seriously throughout this show there are so many other tearbending moments. "
Review: Appa seeing that kid laughing in the crowd and being reminded of Aang will ALWAYS make me cry for the remainder of the episode.
"Review: *Joking *

Sorry buckaroo, but ""Tears from Ba Sing Se"" is the correct answer. "
"Review: Well, my best friend once misread the title of ""Appa's Lost Days"" in a way that made it a whole lot sadder (only one letter was wrong)."
"Review: I always cry when the flashback of his childhood appears, the way he tries to chew that iron bars, will always bring the tears to me."
Review: One of the only two instances in the show where a character bleeds:(
Review: I need to skip this episode or I'll cry
Review: Tbh I still skip these when I rewatch. Can't take seeing Appa sad
Review: My wife was so upset the first time she saw Appa get captured that now when we do a rewatch she makes me skip that episode. 
"Review: It’s one of the strongest episodes for sure, all the more so as they managed to tell the story they wanted with a sum total of about four lines of dialogue."
Review: I only have four words for you: Leaves from the vine
Review: Just rewatched this episode cuz I’m on an avatar binge rn. Didn’t realize how close this ep is to tales of ba sing se. This season is literally just all feels
Review: I still skip this episode when I rewatch. 
Review: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"Review: I just binged the entire first 2 seasons. I just watched this episode and I was almost in tears, seeing appa in such a sad state was the worst thing i ever witnessed."
"Review: I just came here to see how many others die a little inside seeing Appa’s Lost Days. Just followed by the episode where we find Iroh setting up a memorial for his son. Ugh, my heart. 

How the hell did they make an animated make believe beast have such soulful eyes. How."
Review: i always skip this episode - ill end up sobbing either way
Review: When I rewatch avitar I have to skip that episode
Review: Puppetmaster.... Chills down the spine
Review: That episode makes me sob from start to finish 😭 they gave Appa so much depth and it’s a beautiful episode but damn
Review: Who knew appa has bedheads!
"Review: That moment gets me every time, especially when Katara stays while they all flee from him. I’m tearing up just thinking about it. The way she stays through the pain, through the anger, and loves him enough to soothe him.. "
Review: When that music comes in right after he goes “YOU MUZZLED APPA?” chills
"Review: That avatar state was the most badass righteous anger I've seen. There's others, sure...but just everything came together for that moment. "
Review: Personally the tales of ba sing se is the saddest strictly because of the scene where Iroh is setting up a memorial for his dead son and singing
Review: The time he is cleaning himslef from buzzard wasps nectar. and the time he lands to eat some hay made me cry (i never cry at shows) now that is going to haunt me for a month or 2
"Review: Tearbending, I like that"
"Review: Isn't it ""Tales from Ba Sing Se""?"
Review: The sadest one was iroh tale 😢
"Review: Appa’s lost lays? 

He always loved his chips"
"Review: Same , im glad it wasnt his last days."
