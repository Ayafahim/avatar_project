Review
"Review: One of the major complaints is the ending. Aang lies to get the groups to agree and he's pompous about it after words, and worse Katara approves in a very...odd way. Many find that those actions are completely out of character and Aang should have felt depressed that he had to lie to bring about peace. Otherwise the segment is filler with a mostly predictable plot and fairly bland 2-dimentional side characters."
"Review: There's nothing inherently wrong with it. It's just that ATLA has a standard of quality that Great Divide falls completely short of. It's like a bunch of Nickelodeon writers infiltrated the show with demands to make some extremely obvious episode about how we should all work together despite cultural differences. Booo.

Also, Aang feeling totally okay with lying seems weird. Yes, he's something of a careless liar in Season 1 (lying to Katara at the start, then to Sokka about the letter. Lying to Jeong Jeong too.) but they always make sure he feels bad about it. They didn't think out writing this one at all. "
"Review: I think the lie is a bit over exaggerated. We see in the episode that neither tribe remember what actually happened to cause them to be at odds with each other, the fact that they would even believe Aang about their history is quite telling by itself. Both tribes were just holding an ancestral grudge they don't know much about.


I think what it lacked was they we never got to learn what truly happened, I find the two tribes interesting enough that I wanted to know what their fight was about and what the ritual orb was. Otherwise I quite like the Canyon Guide and Aang learning from him the difficulty of being neutral and then seeing Sokka and Katara side with the side most like themselves mainly due to their own argument at the start of the episode. It was a fun episode, though not the most exciting."
Review: I've seen jokes about The Great Divide as being the worst episode. I'd have to nominate The Fortuneteller as a close second
"Review: The worst episode of AtLA is like saying I found the worst pile of gold.

Guess what, you still have gold!"
"Review: Nothing in particular, it simply isn't as strong as a lot of the other episodes. 

The writers even poked fun about the episode in The Ember Island Players. 
"
Review: Its just that it was very out of character for Aang. It sent this bad message that its okay to lie if its convenient. It was also boring as hell.
Review: I Thought It Was All The Fighting.
Review: What episode? 
"Review: The thing is, I don't blame Aang for lying, I mean these tribes have been beefing for YEARS. Lying to stop the fighting isn't that bad when the fighting is as petty as it was."
"Review: Is there a difference between those lies, where he's lying to hide something he's ashamed of, versus the lie in the Great Divide where it's more of a white lie? That's how I see why he could be not too upset over it."
"Review: Aang didn't feel bad abouy lying in this case because he stopped people from hurting

In every other case he hurt people he cares about"
"Review: I agree I felt some non-closure issues about not knowing what actually happened. It was like the writers kind of went ""meh, let's just leave it at that."""
"Review: See, Fortuneteller is the only episode that I have legitimately disliked so far (I'm on S2 Episode 5). Great Divide felt like filler, but I thought it was good filler. The feuding tribes were hilarious, the soundtrack kicked ass and while the way Aang's lie was handled felt somewhat out of character, I find myself agreeing with what others are saying about white lies versus normal lies. He led these people through a canyon full of roid roaches and taught them to see the merits in one another. He got them to work together for the sake of survival. After everything had resolved itself in that canyon, they were prepared to go to war solely due to conflicting legends. While the lie caught me completely off guard, I liked Aang more for being able to do that for the sake of solving a century old feud."
"Review: Weird, I'm pretty sure I really liked that one"
Review: The best way to put it.
"Review: Book 1, Episode 11. It's where the Gaang helps two quarreling tribes cross the canyon and settles their disputes."
"Review: I'm not saying he shouldn't have lied, but I think he shouldn't have reveled in it. It would have been more in character if he regretted not being able to solve the problem without lying."
"Review: It is apples and oranges no doubt. I just don't think Aang is the kind of guy who'd be okay with lying. He should have been more unsure about his actions. Not directly ashamed, but unsure. 
"
"Review: That's why I enjoyed The Great Divide! I guess it was more blatant than the other episodes, but the tribes were still fun to watch. I had fun with the Fortuneteller, too, but I can see where your dislike of the episode could come from. It's like she's obviously a fake but Sokka's the only one to notice so. Even Aang and Katara are smitten by her until the volcano incident. But I think it also goes to show that sometimes people do believe in irrational things because they like to be told what they like to hear."
"Review: ""Worst episode"" was a bad title to use. The times I've seen The Great Divide termed as the ""worst episode"" was because people said it had no business being an episode, or that it didn't advanced the storyline. That is how I felt about The Fortuneteller. It's still a good episode, but just like how many think the Great Divide is useless, I think that way about The Fortuneteller"
Review: Haha it's a joke. Like 'what movie?' 
"Review: Yeah, its is pretty weird how he was ashamed of lying to Sokka and Katara in Bato of the Water Tribe but bragged about lying in this episode."
Review: at the same time he’s still just a kid
"Review: Oh yeah dont get me wrong, there were funny parts like when they asked Sokka if his science could explain the rain. It just seemed to lack that quantity of action and depth present in the others I have seen so far."
"Review: Yeah that might be true, it just never bothered me honestly. It's a good filler episode imo, the great divide a little less so."
"Review: Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too quick, I would catch it."
"Review: One lie is to fix a dispute between two groups that had a petty reason to hate each other, and that lie actually brought unity between those two groups. The other lie is stopping his friends from seeing their dad they haven’t seen in a very long time. They are not the same what so ever, so trying to compare the two lies is stupidity."
Review: You seriously replied to a fucking 8 year old comment just to call me stupid?
"Review: Someone hasn’t grown up in 8 years… I never said you were stupid, I said your comparison was stupid. Learn to read buddy."
Review: There's no apostrophe in were.
"Review: That’s all you had as comeback because you realized you got mad for something I never said. Have a good one, please in the next 8 years actually grow up."
Review: What exactly did you expect when you replied in the first place? You necromanced a dead thread...
"Review: Yes, and part of that is that it leads to nothing. Many episodes get referenced back to later on, whether it is Aunt Wu offering to read Iroh’s future or the swamp people fighting in the invasion. Or it gives backstory to an important character, even Kyoshi. But this does none of that. The tribes’ history isn’t fundamental to any main character or culture, we don’t see any of these people again, and the only thing it establishes is that the avatar needs to make peace. But we knew that already.

I’m not saying it will fix the issue, but I would have loved it if we saw these guys in Ba Sing Se. A cameo appearance at the Jasmine Dragon, for example. We see Hope’s family in several episodes, but never these characters."
"Review: Possibly, but if that’s the worst episode that’s telling how good the series is."
Review: Yeah it’s the only one I’ll skip
"Review: Tbh, I rank “Avatar Day” around the same as The Great Divide.

If only because I hate the fight with the rough rhinos towards the end. Sokka’s interaction with them turns into a cliche “hapless character stumbles into defeating their enemy totally by accident” which isn’t very compelling to me.

We’ve already seen Sokka hold his own. Why turn him into a bumbling fool that beats trained fighters completely by accident?"
"Review: I love this episode
The ending is just great. I love the faces of Katara and Sokka after Aang tells them he just lied. Maybe it's just a translation thing"
"Review: I don't understand why people act as if every episode of a TV show has to further arc storylines or change characters moving forward. What's the problem with characters having a standalone adventure and then just moving along?

I'm not saying the Great Divide is one of my favorites or anything, just that the fact that this particular adventure doesn't come up again doesn't mean it's worse."
"Review: Look it's the great divide. The biggest canyon in the earth kingdom.

Ehhh.. Let's keep flying. 

This about sums up my feelings"
"Review: I actually really like it. Aang has always had a mischievous devious side so it didn’t feel out of character when he lied. I know the episode is pure filler, but sometimes that’s what I want to watch. If I watched say The Storm or Zuko alone I’d watch more episodes because I’m more invested.

Only episode I can’t stand to rewatch is Bato. Iroh and Aang were both out of character. And it’s a shame cause the fight sequence is one of the best in season one."
"Review: It's kinda cannon, no? I mean, the show dissed itself at Ember Island Players, so I guess so"
"Review: It’s the worst episode but it’s still decent, it’s one of the only episodes which I see as filler"
"Review: Yes. While it’s not a bad episode, it is a complete waste of time. Say what you want about the other weaker episodes, they at least contributed something important to either the characters, plot or lore. The Great Divide does nothing, and as such, could be taken out with nothing being lost. Still, if this is the worst episode, then that just goes to show how good the tv show is."
Review: Meh it really isn’t that bad. I liked it 🤷🏽‍♀️ I think it also served a purpose of showing Aang getting used to his avatar duties and having to bring peace on a small scale. It’s a filler ep but really not that bad.
Review: I actually don't hate this episode except the resolution at the end. One that irks me to no end is Bato of the Water Tribe.
Review: This man Aang lies to a whole tribe about their history and basically rewrites it for them. Not Avatar behavior. Super out of character episode for Aang.
"Review: To all the people who are defending Aang’s choice at the end of the episode, yes he does lie in other situations, but that’s not what is out of character. The problem is about how he doesn’t feel bad about it at all. All the other times he lied, he felt guilty, but not here. That’s the issue."
"Review: Personally, I think that “Jet” is the worst episode. Downvote me all you want. I don’t care. It’s my opinion."
"Review: Yes, it is. However, I still like it. It has a lot of lovely ideas and messages throughout it that are presented extremely well. However, a lot of the rest of the episode is substanceless. Additionally, Sokka and Katara are OOC for pinning the actions of the tribe founders on their descendants - because they were established as people who wouldn't do something like that in the previous episode ('Jet'). And, Aang's fibbing to solve the conflict is framed as him acting morally - which is awful."
"Review: From critical reception perspective? Yes, even though it got like a 7.2 or something like that (out of 10)

It’s just outclassed, and it’s the single reason why I can’t say I’ve fully watched the series like 10-15 times, I watched it the first time and skip it since

Do keep in mind this series had like 10-15 episodes that all scored over 9/10, and the bulk of the entire series was comfortably in the 8s/10
Pretty much every episode since Zuko joined the gang had like 9+, Season 1 finale as well, All of Sozin’s comet had 9+/10, with part 3 and 4 scoring like 9.8/10 and part 2 like a 9.5/10

It’s average score was like 8.6, so the great divide is the worst, even though in any other series it would probably be slightly above average"
Review: This is why ATLA is 99% on Rotten Tomatoes
"Review: Is not the worst, is just the less bright gem in the crown"
Review: It’s like Kanye. Even the worst one is still pretty good
Review: If it’s you first time watching the series watch the episode so you can understand the memes if not then skip it
"Review: It’s not bad at all it’s just like solidly mid, like it’s probably the only 6/10 episode. It’s kind of a flex that Avatar only has one mid episode and it’s like not that bad. I just watched it and the guide dude was super weird and funny, the lie twist was awesome to me. If anything weirdly the animation felt a little off, it isn’t as pretty as most other episodes I think the canyon is a really visually boring setting."
Review: Jet is the worst episode
"Review: It's certainly the most underrated episode.

It's probably because it's so universally derided but I actually have quite a bit of affection for it at this point. But genuinely, there's a lot to like about *The Great Divide*.

I'd suggest *Fortuneteller* as the worst episode."
Review: I would say that the episode jet was introduced in is the worst episode. It breaks character of pretty much everybody to enforce plot points
"Review: Absolutely not! “The Ember Island Players” is hands down the worst episode, followed closely by “Nightmares and Daydreams”!"
Review: No
Review: Yes
"Review: No 
Tales of Bai Sing Se or The Fortune Teller"
"Review: Yes, by far, without any real competition. The only good thing about it is that it makes discussions about what the worst episode is pretty short."
"Review: I really enjoy watching the great divide bc I like hearing how different the stories are based off of the different tribes. It shows how much our point of view distorts the truth and blocks us from thinking rationally and morally. I think this episode shows the beginning of the theme that people aren’t inherently bad and that there is good in everyone, which we see later in the series with Zuko’s redemption arc and how he chooses good even though he loves his nation and his people. Early in the series especially katara and sokka feel that everyone in the fire nation is down right evil, similar to how these tribes feel about each other, but in both cases the characters learn not everyone is inherently evil just because you hate them. I think this episode of a small village feud put a microscope on the idea of war in general and how misguided and out of touch people can be when they are blinded by hatred. Additionally I also thing this episode foreshadows the idea that iroh and guru patik (sorry if I got that name wrong!) touch on when they say that everything is connected and the four nations aren’t all that different/ divided (we see this in the great divide when both tribes assume the other one is bad and bring food; essentially they both decided to risk everyone’s safety, so they aren’t all that different after all). So although we don’t see the characters/tribes again, I don’t think it leads to nothing because they introduce a lot of important and recurring ideas that persist throughout the series, which is what I think makes atla so great!

This is all just my take on it though :)) 

personally I think the “worst” or simply my least favorite episode is the one where aang is having nightmares about the invasion (I think maybe it’s called nightmares and daydreams?). Although the part where appa and momo fight is hilarious, I find myself bored the rest of the episode and feel like it doesn’t hold much significance other than showing how aang has so much weighing on his shoulders, which to me is self explanatory without this episode. That doesn’t mean that this episode is bad, I just think it comes in last place when ranking all the episodes."
Review: I really don’t think so. Why does everyone forget about “Nightmares and Daydreams”? Easily a much worse episode.
"Review: I feel this episode is very misunderstood. The moral of the episode I felt was that people fight for no reason. Clearly, both sides didn't know why they fought since they fell for the lie. Likewise, Aang's lie showed that people can also make peace with the thinnest of veils and is just that easy.

It leads back to how tough the Fire nation made things, and that they could have just stopped at any time, but they didn't."
Review: Also if aangs story wasn't a lie at the end of the episode. If that was actually a true story or he actually solved the problem than the episode would've been much better. Like one of the first times he actually helps people without just fighting the bad guys
"Review: Agreed that seeing the Gan Jin and the Zhangs, united, in Ba Sing Se, or even a few show up for Black Sun would have been wonderful.

Thematically though there is resonance between *King of Omashu*, *Divide* and *Comet*.

In *King of Omashu*, Aang is encouraged by Bumi to 'think like a mad genius' i.e. Find creative solutions to problems that aren't immediately obvious.
We see him practice that advice in *Divide*, while we see the ultimate expression of that approach in *Comet* when Aang ignores the advice of his friends and former lives, and instead finds a hitherto unforeseen solution to the problem of Ozai."
"Review: I mean, it does get referenced back again in the 'Ember Island' episode :)"
Review: Tales of Bai Sing Se and The Fortune Teller are just as bad if not worse
Review: This.
"Review: I've thought this a lot. Every series is going to have a ""worst"" episode. This episode is mediocre at worst."
Review: My thoughts exactly
Review: The worst Avatar episode would be just an average episode in a lot of shows
Review: Same
"Review: If it wasn’t for Kyoshi, I would likely place “Avatar Day” below “The Great Divide”."
"Review: Avatar Day had some good moments: Aang getting advice from the prisoners, him being a smartass to the judge-prosecutor guy, and of course Kyoshi.

The Great Divide isn't particularly memorable other than the ending."
Review: This is a mockery of Chin Law!
Review: How? The original language is English
"Review: I totally agree with this.

It is though rather notable though that *The Great Divide*, I think, is the only episode in the entire series which can be removed entirely with no continuity errors subsequently appear elsewhere.

I think the only other example might be *Players*.

I agree it's a silly reason to dislike an episode but it is funny this is the only example."
"Review: I like the episode. It’s a nice, self-contained story. It’s fun, imo."
"Review: It's not a waste of time. It's the only episode which actually shows Aang doing the Avatar's 'day job'. 

The Avatar is supposed to be like the ultimate 3rd party in all disputes. Everyone trusts and respects the Avatar. They are someone that, in principle, is beyond any people or nation. They can be totally impartial.

This is a very important person to have at the table during a dispute and I would say that this is what the Avatar's main role is. They're not saving the world or fighting spirits all the time. Mostly they are diplomatic figures.

This episode shows, perhaps crudely, exactly that taking place. It shows how difficult and even how lonely that role can be.

It's not the best episode ever. But it's not a waste of time."
"Review: The same thing goes for ""Sense and Insensitivity"" from The Owl House."
"Review: I wish people would stop saying everything even remotely morally grey is ""out of character"" for Aang.

Aang started the show by lying about who he was. Then he lied to Katara and Sokka about their father. And then he lied to settle some baseless, idiotic conflict between 2 groups of people, which they themselves didn't even know about, seeing how easy they were persuaded by Aang's bullshitting. That's literally the most mild one of those 3 instances."
"Review: It’s the most airbender solution though. And Aang lies about a few things, some arguably more important."
"Review: He's 11, hungry, and tired plus he stopped a meaningless blood fued with a white lie. I actually like this episode. It shows two cultures completely hating each other on principle and prejudice that was stopped with a white lie. 

It shows how meaningless generational grudges are. They could have used a more meaningful metaphor but it's a child's show. Do we want to here about another genocide in the avatar universe. I'm positive Nickolodeon wouldn't."
"Review: I do wonder what really happened, though"
Review: Why would he feel bad? He just solved a meaningless conflict that brought nothing but problems for generations to people that don't even know what the original cause of it was.
Review: Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I am curious why you don't like that one though? I thought it was pretty good
Review: I’ve seen it already
Review: What a hot take 👀
Review: I also hate this episode
Review: Hmmm. Why do you think that?
Review: Agreed! For my money Nightmares and Daydreams is the worst episode by far.
Review: Glad someone else mentioned Nightmares and Daydreams. Not sure what the general consensus is on the episode but was afraid of being the first and getting burned at the stake.
"Review: I like ember island players. But agree on nightmares and daydreams being bad. Except the part where he is daydreaming "" baby you're my forever girl."""
Review: what is the worst one in your opinion?
Review: What the fuck did you said about tales from Ba Sing Se?!
"Review: I didn’t think of it like that, but I like it. Wish that was made a little more obvious (even if it was just Katara instead saying “You didn’t?! That is so mad!” or something), but oh well."
Review: Lol! Kinda
Review: How dare you!
"Review: I think Fortune Teller focuses on the romance subplot enough for it to be relevant. There is a lot of Kataang moments in there.

Tales is one of those slower episodes that is all downtime. If the cast is good, you’ll find those episodes are pretty beloved because they reveal character. Aang and Sokka to a lesser extent, but the others are more revealing. We see Toph’s reactions to “being pretty” and we see the two bond since usually they butt heads. We see Zuko actually take his uncle’s advice and live in the city, but we also see him open up a little at the end; instead of letting the slammed door be the final word like he would have in book 1, he gives Iroh an answer. And although we know Iroh and Momo are grieving about their losses, we get a chance to fully see it. Also we see Iroh’s infectious good nature which is just wholesome (and that’s why the final shot hurts even more.) TLDR: I think there is enough character exploration for Tales to be an important episode."
"Review: ""Gee I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil"" I love that line so much"
Review: Yeah I loved the whole sokka Sherlock thing and that prisoners bit is SO funny
"Review: I agree as well.   


I think it might be because it's the most memorable episode where nothing big happens. Like I can remember better than most other episodes  despite having seen the series multiple times.   


And if it's the most memorable, then it can quickly become the most boring."
"Review: Additionally, I don't know that 'Avatar behaviour' necessarily means honest behaviour.

There's not actually anything that says that the Avatar's supposed to be a paragon of human virtue is there? The Avatar's job is just to create and maintain peace throughout the world. Objectively Aang succeeds in that endeavour in this episode, regardless of means.

Avatars are not supposed to be saints. If anything, it could be argued that Avatars are 'supposed' to be sacrificial lambs when it comes to virtue. The Avatar is supposed to live outside society and bear sins on its behalf.

Blessed Yangchen herself, in-universe, the most revered Avatar before Aang, councils that the Avatar should be ready to put the needs of the world before their own spiritual needs. This, alongside the other Avatars' advice to Aang, tends to suggest a pretty utilitarian (rather than idealistic or solely virtuous) approach to problem solving."
Review: A crucial part of the founding of Republic City involved Aang feeding Kuei some b.s. and Kuei believing it. This type of tactic is just simply something Aang is comfortable doing.
"Review: I just don’t like Jet, so since that episode is all about him, I don’t really enjoy it."
Review: Then skip
Review: I actually rewatched all of my least favorite episodes recently to see if they were really as bad as I thought they were. The great divide isn’t that bad ( although it’s still pretty bad). Jet is still as horrible as I thought it was before.
"Review: Sokka seems wishy washy part way through, katara comes off as blind and naive, aang is just along for the ride until he finds out what the plan really is. The entite episode felt like contrived conflict for the sake of having conflict. At least the great divide showcases aang’s skills (or lack of) as a diplomat. The entire episode was an allegory for bigotry and prejudice stemming from ignorance and a refusal to look past differences to find common ground. It was actually a brilliantly written episode, trashed on by fans because it’s “filler” and therefore “irrelevant” because you can skip it and not lose any story at all outside of “oh they crossed the gap already, that was fast” (I expected a multi episode event out of it)"
Review: It's bad
"Review: 


The Fortune Teller is a filler episode.it shows Katara and Aang relationship in the last 3 minutes...


For the Tales of Bai Sing Se ....Toph low self esteem is not why I watch ATLA....

.
Iroh good nature helping people also is not interesting or why I Watch ATLA.


Iroh we know his son died that's all the episode told.It wasn't a backstory episode that gave any relevant or important information....


 the storm was a back story episode and the avatar and the firelord,not Tales of Bai Sing Se it was a Filler episode...."
"Review: It's memorable to a lot of people because it was the most frequently repeated episode, probably precisely because it was so standalone.

This repetition got a generation of fans weary of it and cemented its status as 'least popular' episode. At some point peoples stopped asking whether 'least popular' was definitely the same as 'worst'."
"Review: > Avatars are not supposed to be saints.

This 100%

Everything also becomes 10x more interesting once you accept this fact. When you realise you don't have to criticize all the bad things Aang does as ""bad writing"" or ""out of character,"" everything becomes much more enjoyable. Aang not being a perfect father, because he is not a saint and can't juggle being the Avatar, teaching Tenzin, founding RC *and* being the perfect dad to Bumi and Kya, creates a lot more depth for his character and how other characters engage with that side of him.

> The Avatar's job is just to create and maintain peace 

And there are so many more roads that lead to Rome other than being Jesus incarnate. And I find the morally questionable roads far more interesting anyway, which is why I find Aang pretty boring as a character. He is too much of a goody two shoes for me, even if I did list some questionable things in my earlier comment. Those are too blatant and resolved too quickly to consider significant."
"Review: This is such an insightful post, I love it!"
Review: Why don’t you like the episode Jet?
Review: Oh that alright is your opinion anyway
Review: ATLA is not why I watch ATLA
"Review: I mean, we see Aang’s feelings for Katara throughout the whole episode. It’s kind of the driving force of that episode. That combined with Katara’s drive to learn about her future. It’s more than just the last 3 minutes.

And yeah, Tales isn’t a backstory episode. But we still see sides of characters that we don’t usually see. You might not be here for Toph being vulnerable or Iroh being helpful even as he is hurting, but others are.

But to each their own, I guess."
"Review: I was more talking about my experience since it was never on when I was a kid. (Not sure if it wasn't shown in the UK or I just didn't watch the right channel). So every episode I've seen is has to be a roughly equal number.  


Also I doubt they would play one episode more than the rest? Since that's more work since they usually stick them on loop. I'd argue people would think it was shown more because people remembered it better and thus enjoyed it less when repeated. And ""bad"" things always feel like they happen more often.   


The episode reminds me of the episode of Futurama where Fry goes to University with the Monkey. It's one the episodes I remember the best despite being quite vanilla so I end up skipping it on re-watches. I haven't seen it more but maybe it's something to do with the clear cut / linear plot in both that makes it more memorable."
Review: Thanks! I was pretty pleased with it.
Review: Cuz Katara literally trusts a guy she just met over her own brother.
"Review: ATLA was certainly shown in the UK on the Nickelodeon channel. 

And *Divide* is infamous for being broadcast more often. *King of Omashu* too."
"Review: Wasn’t Nickelodeon only with sky in the UK?

I’d still like to see the numbers rather than confirmation bias.

Since every fandom thinks the “bad” episode is shown far more often."
"Review: As far as I know Nickelodeon was only packaged with Sky. 

You'll probably be waiting for a while if you're hoping for scheduling data from 15 years ago."
