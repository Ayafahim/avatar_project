    ""comment"": ""This episode is such an underrated gem. Sokka is the backbone of the Gaang and is constantly pushing himself to be half as valuable as the others 'inherently' are as benders.\n\nThis episode is beautiful and sad and poignant. What does it feel like to be the worst at something? To be the weak link? (Even if you aren't) It is a tremendous weight to carry around for anyone, let alone a teenager. In this episode he finds the strength and value that he had all along-- and the group finds it too. He is not just Sokka: the meat and sarcasm guy, but, rather, the brilliant, creative, unique 'leader' and heart of this group. Plus the space sword is dope as hell.""

It’s cute little Aang in this outrageous outfit for battle with that heavy guitar music playing in the background.  Then if that wasn’t enough you’ve got him making the sound effects of a wind sword before he promptly falls over.  It’s funny and sweet and exactly the kind of humor that made ATLA so popular.""

    ""comment"": ""First timer here.\n\n* Again, [look at how Toph gets concerned](https://i.imgur.com/HxZRg3W.png) only after the meteor lands, when she is able to feel it. The little things matter.\n* Oh my god, [swole Iroh](https://i.imgur.com/DpCHFnL.png) is the character I never knew I wanted. It hasn't been that long since he was captured in Ba Sing Se, has it? The prison diet must do wonders for him. It also made me a little ashamed of my fitness regimen during the quarantine.\n* \""Who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time?\"" I know Toph deserves praise, but not right now Aang.\n* [Not the greatest choice of apparel](https://i.imgur.com/sYPrml1.png) when your skills require you to move your body effectively. It does get all the badass points though, which might just make it worth it.\n* So Toph learned earth-bending from the badger moles. How did that even work? Did she feel the vibrations when they earth-bent?\n* if anyone would find a master in the Fire Nation, I didn't think it would be Sokka. Not that you would see me complaining.\n* [That expression of pure bewilderment](https://i.imgur.com/wcXeU1n.png). I liked how they built upon Sokka's creative skills as well rather than only making him \""better\"" at sword-fighting. And say what you may, he is determined to better himself. Who else would painstakingly make a sword out of meteorite?\n* Sokka's training was probably one of the shortest ones we've seen until now. Which kinda makes sense considering the strict deadline they're under. At least he got initiated into the Order of the White Lotus. This was yet another example that I think points to its members being tribe-agnostic.\n* This episode was so long overdue. From the episode in which the gaang broke into the Ba Sing Se palace, Sokka seemed outclassed in almost every fight. I love smart and resourceful Sokka, and I'm so excited to see what he does with his sword and fresh new skills.""

    ""comment"": ""This is one of my favorite episodes of the whole series, love the character arc that Sokka has, I love how Piandao knew all the time about the Avatar and Sokka being not from the fire nation, but still teaching him.\n\nMany people often say that this episode is unnecessary, but for me, it is the culmination of Sokka's character arc, which was never elaborated on in this way in previous episodes. It also shows how the group is so established and united that when someone is missing (Sokka) his absence is really noticeable.""

    ""comment"": ""I really like the subtle jabs the writers take at some of the criticisms of this show through jokes in this episode. Some people don’t like how goofy sokka is, the gaang being bored without sokka is the writers saying “look how boring this show would be without sokka”. Another one is how some people dont like how the character designs are a little simplistic so they put aang in this ridiculously over designed costume and show how while it may look nicer, aang cant move at all. Simpler designs allow for more fluid animation. \n\nAlso I know a lot of people say the last two episodes feel like they’re just filler (and i do agree this season has pacing issues) but i hope now people can at least see what the writers were trying to do, they’re giving the characters their own episodes.\nThe headband was centered around aang.\nPainted lady was kataras.\nThis is one is obviously sokkas but the the difference this time is this one had actual character development for the character it focused on.\n\n>!The next one is on the fire nation antagonists but its mainly zukos and as always he steals the show because imo “the beach” is the best out of all these character centric episodes. We get tophs episode later on in the runaway and seeing as how she wasn’t introduced until a couple episodes into season 2 it even makes sense to delay hers and have the four original main characters go first. The writers perfect these episodic character driven episodes in the second half of this season with the “zuko field trip” episodes and use them as a way to really establish a relationship between zuko and each of the members of the gaang (minus toph, rip) before the finale. This is why season 3 is the best!!<""

    ""comment"": ""This is my second time re-watching the series (after watching it when it first aired). Here are my thoughts:\n\n---\""Sokka's Master\"" is truly one of my favorite episodes from this season. This episode solidifies Sokka's unmatchable warrior heart and honor. It also depicts how essential Sokka is to the gaang. \n\n\n---At the beginning of this episode, Sokka really believes he isn't special because he can't bend any element. We can't blame him for feeling this way because anyone in his position in the gaang would feel the same. Although the gaang knows Sokka is truly special, and no one sees him as just a regular guy, as Katara so lovingly reminds him, it is time for Sokka's to have his own journey. \n\n\n---It is Sokka's honesty that Piandao is attracted to. It's what makes him decide Sokka is truly worthy of training. \n\n\n---It is Sokka's heart of a warrior that Piandao observes in training, and that ultimately earns him his well deserved respect. \n\n\n---I just noticed Piandao's training arena floor has a giant white lotus tile. \n\n\n---Aang: \""Say something funny\""\nSokka: \""Funny how?\""\nAm I the only one that cracks up laughing on this part?\n\n---Seeing Sokka forge his own sword from raw materials is the most badass and inspirational part of this episode. Like Piandao says, \""I wouldn't have it any other way.\""\n\n\n---Sokka admitting he lied about his identity and proudly proclaiming he is from the Southern Water Tribe is what defines him. He will always be proud of who he is, and he will always remain true to himself no matter where he is. \n\n\n---The sword battle is just epic. And I love how Sokka can still be a goofball and a warrior at the same time even in the middle of a presumably life-threatening battle. \n\n\n---Sokka is the warrior spirit of the gaang. Without him there is no gaang. \n\n\n---Lastly, Buff Uncle Iroh for President!""

    ""comment"": ""This is one of my favorite episodes because it highlights my boy Sokka! His struggles and feelings of unworthiness seem more relatable than any other character to me. This episode also demonstrated how integral Sokka was to the group morale, and I loved seeing Katara, Aang, and Toph’s POV while Sokka is training. Creating the sword was out of a meteor was literally the most Sokka thing to do, and it really was a physical symbol of his creativity, growth, and leadership since book 1. I love Sokka so much!!!""

    ""comment"": ""Any thoughts of the significance of Sokka's sword being crafted from material from space? Perhaps a gift from his celestial ex-girlfriend?\n\nThere does seem to be a theme of Sokka having a  relationship with the \""otherwordly\"" aspects of the universe, outside of the four elements. Both supernatural (Yue and the moon, he's the only main character to spend time in the spirit world during the course of the show besides Aang), and in science (shows a knack for science at the Air Temple, his idea to use the eclipse to their advantage, sword made from space material). Maybe that is the show's way of making for Sokka not being able to bend any of the classic elements.""

It’s one of the few aspects of the show I actively dislike when I watch it through.""

The writing is beautiful, Sokka’s an amazing character that often overlooked in favor of his traveling companions, and it deals with really apt themes. Sometimes I wonder if the gaang really realizes how much they need their friendly meat and sarcasm guy in order to function. He's the glue keeping them together—he's always the one keeping them focused and safe, but is also the first to lighten the mood and keep them laughing. Aang and Katara wouldn't have made it past the first iceberg without him. Its nice to see him get some credit for once.\n\n>!Super off topic note: So Piandao trained Zuko, right? Can we just imagine little Zuko running around doing these tasks or making a sword for a sec? He probably took forever doing everything because he was so determined to get it right!<""

It doesn't make sense that Sokka's insecurities about not being useful in the team resurface after all the times he came up with the plans, held his own in battles and also met his father who reassured him that he was a true warrior. The premise just comes out of nowhere. Other than that, it's pretty nice to see a non-bender be respected as a genuine master and more White Lotus hints are always welcome.""

There are dozens of examples of him being the \""plan guy\"" and the show makes it clear that the team would not get far without him. He doesn't need to be a great warrior to validate his worth.\n\n>!And frankly, there's not a lot of payoff to the training. There's that one moment in DoBS, but that doesn't seem like something he wasn't capable of before. !<\n\nTbh I really dislike the slow-paced \""hangout vibe\"" of the first half of Book 3. It's not that all the episodes are bad, but there are so many more interesting things the show could be exploring given the limited amount of time remaining.""

Feeling like the weakest link, like the dumb one. \n\nI love that they weren't just BSing him to make him feel better when they told him he was the best at making plans, reading maps, and even making jokes. When he wasn't there, they actually struggled with that. \n\nI love the message of this. That you shouldn't feel worthless, but at the same time, you should always strive to improve yourself. Sokka became a better swordsman, but he wasn't suddenly useful just because he got a cool new sword. He was always a contributing member in the Gaang. \n\nI love that his sword duel shows how creative he is, thinking very quickly on his feet.""

Sokka often gets the short end of the stick, and it's absolutely heartbreaking when he finally admits that his inability to bend makes him feel inferior. It's clear he struggles with his self-esteem, and both this episode as well as the first episode with Jet make me so happy that Sokka can see and truly appreciate his worth. I felt so happy for Sokka when at the end Piandao, one of the Fire Nation's greatest swordsmen, was so proud to call him his pupil.""

And because the audience already knows that Sokka isn't useless, and the Gaang already knows Sokka isn't useless (but for the sake of the plot they conveniently forgot here), I guess we needed an episode Sokka learns that he isn't useless for some contrived reason... by someone else telling him he's not useless. \n\n> Katara takes one look at this and says, \""The fire is gonna destroy that town.\""\n\n>> Um, Katara, this is the Fire Nation. Odds are, they have firebenders in that town; I'm pretty sure they can handle it. And even that assumes that the fire will be able to sustain itself to any degree on the short grass between itself and the town.\n\nIt shit like this that reminded me of the movie that shan't be named and the way it approached dealing with Firebending. Basically, the firebenders for some reason could not bend without an established outside source for their flames. So their had to a fire place, or pyre, or something that was on fire in order for a firebender to do their thing. Which is so damn stupid. Part of the cool about the Avatar bending system was that 2 elements needed a source and 2 didn't, it gave it a sense of balance. But apparently not the case for the movie, and what made it dumber was that movie-Iroh ruins all this by Firebending without a source anyway, and somehow all who witness this are absolutely shocked... \n\nAnyway, my point is that I was always curious about what Firebenders do when there is a natural wildfire, can they control it? Or can they only generate their own flames?\n\n> Toph says that she misses the hero worship now that they have to go around incognito. Which sounds nice and all...\n\n>> Until you realize that it makes no sense coming out of Toph's mouth! What hero worship did she even experience? Sure, there was plenty of hero worship in Season 1, but she wasn't around then. In Season 2, the Gaang got a bit of hero worship from the pregnant couple, but their defeat of the Drill was followed by the introduction of the Dai Li. Maybe they got a bit from the Earth King, but that's about it. So what in the hell is she talking about?\n\nMaybe Aaron Ehasz knows.../s\n\n> On the commentary for this section, Brian Konietzko (one of the co-creators of the series) said, [\""Everything that Aang is wearing represents stylistic elements that Mike and I don't really care for.\""](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/S3E04_9112.jpg) Um, OK. But why is it here? You're not really poking fun at it. And the references are so muddled and incomprehensible that it's impossible to even know what these stylistic elements actually are. You can't just put a bunch of stuff into a blender, plop it onto the screen, and expect us to know what the hell you're talking about. And it certainly doesn't amount to satire or mockery.\n\nNot gonna lie, when I was a kid I was a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors and had owned 3 & 5XL. So I felt like I knew what this was referencing, but years have passed since and now I can't really say I do what's being referenced here. So maybe someone can help me out here? Someone at the end of the review says it supposed to reference JRPGs and a few Anime, but like, which Anime? Who the fuck actually dresses like this? I *guess* some Final Fantasy characters dress this way? W.O.L definitely comes to mind when I think of his depiction in Dissidia, but that's it really.\n\n> **Down the Rabbit Hole**\n\nEven though I agree, I don't much care for Piandao being a Gary Stu tbh. He's not really all that interesting as a character going by his history. I think it's cool that he's based on Sifu Kisu, but I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't cool how they didn't make another character for Sifu [Manny](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Manuel_Rodriguez) considering what he helped bring to the table. So overall, he's a very meh character. But hey, I guess the kiddies needed **another** reminder that \""not all Fire Nation folk are evil\"" :/\n\nThis episode as a whole is pretty meh for me as well. The only thing of interest is the fact that Sokka's sword is made of meteorite. Oh, and Iroh gettin swole!""

In Book 3 they *sort of* have some time to calm down, as in things are *sort of* settled and they have to wait for things to happen, without rushing to prepare everything. When you've been stressed out and rushing for a long period of time and it ends and you're left with long periods of time with nothing but your thoughts for company, your brain starts to process all that stress. \n\nI seem to remember Sokka having a few throwaway lines every now and then about being the odd man out, so it's not like this comes out of *absolutely* nowhere. Besides, it's a weekly show, *everything* comes out of nowhere. It's not like the Great Ravine was foretold several episodes in advance.""

Yes we have seen sokken being useful, but its been a theme throughout that sokken feels less worthy in the group when everyone ia doing their bending, while also doubting his skills as a warrior (even though hes always been a good one). This episode doesnt just reaffirm him as a good warrior and teammate, but also gives him the master-pupil connection all the others have, including toch with the badgermoles.\n\nBesides that im happy so much of season 3 is hangout vibe, the show is about defeating the big baddie sure, but so much of the show is just the amazing characters being themselves, and exploring who they are. One of my top 3  episodes, tales of ba sing se, does nothing to move the plot but thats what makes it a good episode. The stakes are relatively low, but you get to see the traits of each character so well. This master episode does that for sokka, who got the least impressive tale of ba sing se segment.""
