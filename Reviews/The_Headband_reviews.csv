It debuted on September 28, 2007."
"Review: Upon entering the Fire Nation, Aang and his friends steal local clothes in order to live incognito among the citizens. Aang wears a headband to hide his airbender tattoos. After accidentally putting on a Fire Nation school uniform and being accused of truancy, Aang is taken to that school. Enjoying being able to socialize like a 'normal' kid and realizing the value of learning about the Fire Nation, he enrolls in the school. He later arranges a dance party for the rigidly disciplined and self-expression lacking Fire Nation pupils. When the school authorities learn about the party, the students help Aang and his friends escape. Meanwhile, Zuko hires an assassin to find and kill Aang."
"Review: Zukotosses and turns in his sleep before he eventually awakens and arises from his bed. He makes his way toward aFire Nationprisonand looks distantly toward it. As he stands near the entrance, a guard spies him from the roof and demands to know Zuko's identity, but rather than reveal it, Zuko simply walks away."
"Review: Meanwhile,Aangand the others are traveling through the Fire Nation, using a combination ofwaterbendingandairbendingto hideAppain a cloud. They take temporary shelter in acaveand seek out new clothes so they can blend in with the Fire Nation citizens, eliminating the need to hide. They find an unattended clothesline and steal some outfits- with Toph modifying her shoes by removing the soles. Aang shyly blushes whenKataraappears in her new outfit, but quickly indicates that she has to remove hermother'snecklacein order for them to stay hidden. Afterward, they venture into abazaarto purchase some accessories, including a new necklace for Katara."
"Review: In town, the group attempts to blend in and act natural, which is somewhat impeded by Aang, who, having traveled through the Fire Nation a century before, claims to be an expert of their customs. He calls people he sees on the street ""hotman"" and uses other expressions that are clearly out of date. When the others go to buy food from a meat stand, Aang abstains due to his vegetarianism and goes off on his own for a bit. However, he is quickly caught by a group of soldiers who escort him into a classroom. His stolen clothing happens to be the uniform ofa local schooland the soldiers assume that he is a truant.The teacherassumes he is a new student from theFire Nation coloniesin theEarth Kingdom. Aang calls himselfKuzonafter his old Fire Nation friend and attempts to blend in at the school with partial success. After failing to do a proper greeting to the teacher, he fixes it with some hints from a nearby girl. The teacher also informs Aang about the rules against headwear, but he claims that it is to hide an embarrassing scar. After dismissal, he meets a friendly girl namedOn Ji, as well as On Ji's apparent boyfriend,Hide, a popular student with a much more aggressive personality. After a brief confrontation, Aang winds up making friends and playing a game known as ""hide and explode"" withShojiand other children from the school."
"Review: Aang, covered in soot as a result of the game, returns to the cave at nightfall, to the relief of Katara,Sokka, andToph, who were worried by his long absence. The fact that he had been attending a Fire Nation school all day shocks Aang's friends, especially Sokka. When Aang claims to have enjoyed the experience and wishes to return to the school the next day, Sokka strongly objects. Aang argues that he is obtaining valuable knowledge about the Fire Nation and manages to convince the warrior to allow him to continue attending the school. Aang joyfully exclaims, ""Flamey-O, hotman!"" to Sokka, who becomes utterly confused by his statement."
"Review: Meanwhile, Zuko returns to the prison. When confronted by the guard from the previous night, he aggressively threatens him not to tell anyone about his visit and proceeds to enterIroh's cell. Iroh turns away from him, showing great disappointment in his nephew. Zuko blames Iroh for the latter's circumstances and states that the two could have returned to the Fire Nation together as heroes. Iroh still refuses to speak, sending Zuko into a fit of rage and prompting him to leave."
"Review: The next day at school, Aang gets in trouble for not reciting the Fire Nation Oath correctly, having never previously heard it. The students think his bumbling through the oath is a funny joke, but the teacher punishes his disruption of the class by calling for a pop quiz on the Fire Nation's history. The first question asks for the year in which Fire LordSozindefeatedtheAir NationArmy. Aang, confused, asks if it was a trick question and points out that the Air Nomads had no formal military and were defeated by an ambush, much to the class' astonishment. The teacher rejects his claim, as it is not in the Fire Nation's history texts, and states that he could not know that unless he had been there. Aang responds that he will just write down his best guess."
"Review: In band class, Aang tries to play thetsungi hornand gets chided bythe teacherfor dancing, which apparently is not considered proper in the Fire Nation. Nevertheless, On Ji is amused by the dance, though when Aang offers to show it to her during recess, he incurs the wrath of Hide, who attempts to hit him. However, Aang skillfully evades every attempted blow with his hands behind his back, eventually getting the clearly outmatched Hide to stumble and fall over without any bending or even touching him. However, this gets Aang into trouble for ""roughing up"" a favored student of theHeadmaster, resulting in a parent-teacher conference. Sokka and Katara attend the conference acting as Aang's parents, ""Mr. Wang Fire"" and ""Mrs. Sapphire Fire"". Concluding the conference, the Headmaster warns them that any more disruption will result in ""Kuzon"" being sent to reform school, namely the coal mines. While they manage to succeed in fooling the teacher, Sokka is against Aang returning to school by saying ""No more school for you, young man."" Aang, however, tells Sokka that this is the first time since he found out that he was theAvatarthat he has had the chance to be a normal kid and insists that they need to do something for the children in the school in order to allow them to have freedom of expression for at least a brief period of time. Since these students are the next generation of the Fire Nation, changing them might help. He plans to hold a secret dance party in the cave for everyone in the school, to which Sokka, still wearing his beard, responds with an irritated, ""Go to your room!"""
"Review: Meanwhile, Zuko has a romantic picnic withMaiand they share a kiss. The two are interrupted byAzula, who tries to get Zuko to talk to her. He refuses, but Azula sends Mai away by saying thatTy Leeneeds help untangling her braid. Mai complies politely but gives Azula an angry look behind her back. Azula tricks Zuko into admitting that he was visiting Iroh and warns him, with apparent sincerity, not to do so, as his visiting a traitor would make others suspicious. Nevertheless, Zuko visits his uncle in prison again. Again Iroh merely faces away from Zuko, who attempts to be kinder, bringing his uncle food as a gift. He begs his uncle for his advice, explaining that he believes the Avatar to be alive and that he is confused and has no idea what to do about it without Iroh's guidance. When Iroh remains silent, Zuko flies into another rage, berating him, and leaves. As he leaves, Iroh continues to remain silent, but a tear runs down his face."
"Review: Back in the cave, the children arrive and theschool bandbegins to play. However, they are stunned by nervousness, not knowing how to dance, and afraid they will get in trouble. Aang demonstrates some dance forms and eventually asks On Ji to dance, which gradually encourages the rest of the students to do the same. Sokka states that Aang and On Ji look good together, to which Katara gives a slightly terse response. The students gradually start to freestyle, although Toph, Sokka, and Katara do not join in. Later, Aang asks Katara to dance. After hesitating, she takes Aang's hand and they perform a combination of Bagua and Northern Shaolin in synchronization, which does indeed appear to be an acrobatic dance based on their bending techniques - the students are all awed. At the end of the dance, Katara and Aang share a moment of what looks like mutual attraction. However, the Headmaster and several soldiers appear on the scene, having been told of the dance by Hide. They try to catch Aang, but he hides within the crowd of kids. Because the soldiers identify Aang with his headband, they are thrown off when they discover several other students wearing the same headband. Eventually, every student in the cave appears to have put one on, effectively delaying the Headmaster's hunt for Aang."
"Review: Team Avatar manages to slip away in the opening behind the cave. However, before leaving, Aang stops and exchanges smiles with Shoji before running off, closing the opening behind him withearthbending, leaving Shoji shocked and speechless. Some of the soldiers accept defeat and dance as well, much to the chagrin of the Headmaster."
"Review: While the group flies off on Appa, Toph compliments Aang on his efforts, which she believes made a serious impact on the students. Katara agrees, thanks Aang for dancing with her and kisses him on the cheek, causing him to blush. Sokka refuses to take his fake beard off, claiming, ""It's permanently glued to [his] skin""."
"Review: Meanwhile, Zuko walks into a dark alley at night. There he meetsa mysterious manwith a metal arm and leg, as well as atattooedthird eye. Zuko states his purpose for contacting the man: he has heard the man is capable of doing his job effectively and secretly, and he wants him to track down and eliminate the Avatar."
Review: I always really liked the look of Aang with hair for some reason
"Review: I LOVE this episode! I know it’s kind of filler but it’s so cute. I love how Aang just... goes to school. It’s such a fun plot point because he’s never really experienced a normal childhood, and he can just be a kid for once without having to worry about the Fire Lord! I did feel bad he had to cover his arrow, though. The symbolism of the arrows and the Fire Nation buns is so interesting to me!

Katara’s Fire Nation outfit is AMAZING. I’m a sucker for costume creation, and a sucker for characters changing costumes. (Totally Spies, anyone?) it’s like Katara was made to wear Fire Nation clothes! I also enjoyed Toph customizing her shoes. Very on-brand. 

I’m obsessed with the scene where Aang is being harassed by On Ji’s boyfriend, Hide! Aang dodges every single attack and leaves the guy to make an absolute fool of himself, by himself. You know the Fire Nation kids talked about Kuzon for a loooong time! And in the true spirit of school, Aang is punished while Hide walks free. 

Katara and Sokka acting as parents and Katara being “pregnant” is not something I thought I’d see when I started watching this show... but I love how Sokka introduces himself as Wang Fire (a choice for sure) and Katara is Sapphire Fire. Kinda dumb, but I always chuckle. 

When Aang throws a cave party, I will never forget the chubby kid saying his parents don’t want him dancing in a cave. Out of all the dialogue in all the episodes, this line in particular  really stuck with me! The delivery was perfect. Him sinking into his shirt collar gets me every time. 

I love the Aang and Katara dance scene, it’s so cool! The moves they do and how Aang tells Katara to just focus on him... it’s just so sweet. If anyone is in Kataang denial I would like to direct you to this particular scene. I also loved Aang’s traditional Fire Nation dances, I thought they were super cool and memorable! 

Now for Zuko...

The scene of Zuko hiring the assassin always confused me. Where did he find this guy? How did he contact him? How did Zuko even know he existed? My best guess is Zuko got his information from a guard or something, but still. He’s been on the run for 3 years. Did he know about this guy beforehand?! There’s just so many minor logistical details that I would really like to explore further...

The fact that Iroh doesn’t talk to Zuko is so heartbreaking to watch. Zuko is obviously remorseful underneath all his anger and confusion, but he’s taken so many steps back that put him right back to square one. I guess Angry Zuko is back... sigh 

Anyway, I love this episode and I think it’s really cute."
"Review: I LOVE THIS EPISODE. IT NEVER GETS OLD

Aang with hair and headband and fire nation gaang looks in general such good design 🔥🔥

Flameo hotmen is probably one of my favorite jokes and if you think about it Aang using 100 year old slang is like someone using a slang word from 1921 causally. Just the comedy in general in this episode is great.

The inside look at fire nation schools and indoctrination is awesome worldbuilding and just shows how the fire nation has kept its citizens in check since birth. Especially the changing history how Aang knows their wasnt an air nomad army, plus the fact they have to pledge to ozai (reminds me of a certain pledge of allegiance) They also don’t even let them express themselves through dancing as that may lead to independent thoughts 

For the first time, we see Aang really hanging out with kids his age and not worrying about being the avatar or anyone knowing he is. It’s perfect for him because he gets to be a kid like he has always wanted and I feel so bad for him. He might have gotten some of that at the air temples before others knew he was the avatar, but then we saw the kids treated him differently. Plus, the only person who is his age in the gaang is Toph, both katara and sokka are at least two years older then him. 

Again Aang pulling out 100 year dance moves imagine ur at a club and a guy just starts doing some shit from 1921 honestly I don’t blame these kids for being scared 

Lmao sokka and katara as aang’s parents wang fire like I guarantee no ones last name in the fire nation is fire lmao it was so  funny to me as well as Aang beating that guy without even throwing a punch 

THE MUSIC IN THIS EPISODE ESPECIALLY THE CAVE MUSIC IS SOOOO FIREEEEE also the lighting of the cave and the dance moves and the design of everything ugh so good 

Lol aang’s noodle portrait of ozai 

Aang pulls mad chicks at school but he only wants katara my man is basically cuffed sorry 

Aang and katara’s relationship here bro they’ve come so far and they just looking into each other’s eyes and dancing so wholesome “it’s just you and me right now” like this is the same kid who was like “sooooooo ….papaya?” wtf did getting zapped by Azula just instantly make this man smooth as hell and the finish 🔥🔥plus he gets a kiss at the end I love their book 3 moments 

The kids helping out Aang just shows us that these kids aren’t inherently bad. They’re just being indoctrinated into basically a cult like mentality to become adults to serve the fire nation only. I liked it

Oh, and of course Zuko hires an assassin to do his work, he wants the avatar gone without getting into it. Gives a nice cliffhanger 

It was a nice change course from the sad and emotional last episode to a fun one with some epic dance moves and comedy. I love book 3 and hopping from vibe to vibe episode to episode is great 

UNDERRATED EPISODE. FLAMEO HOTMAN. END OF STORY"
"Review: It shouldn't be possible for a filler episode to be one of my favorites in a series unless it is really, really enjoyable and interesting.  Luckily, ""The Headband"" is.  While it seems in some ways like a deviation from the main story, in many others it's not.  The episode also doubles as a continuation of the developing romance between Katara and Aang.  It also provides our hero with an opportunity to take a breather from his Avatar problems and live like a kid.  And why not?  This episode is the perfect opportunity for such an occasion.

There are also bits of humor that work so well in this half-hour.  Katara and Sokka pretending to be Aang's parents when he gets into trouble with the headmaster is hilarious, as is the bit where they steal clothes.

Then of course, there's the Kataango scene.  Not only do we learn that Aang is a magnificent dancer, he also has a romantic side to him, too.  This episode shows he's come a long way from his clumsy attempts at complimenting.  When he tells Katara, ""It's just you and me right now"" and she makes seductive eyes at him, you know that 1) this is most likely going to result with the two of them together, and 2) he really can be charming without being artificial about it.  In fact, he manages to sweep Katara off her feet in this episode far better than Jet ever did.  The dance between them is electrifyingly choreographed and even, dare I say it, a bit sexy.  It seems odd to have such a scene in a series supposedly for kids, but on the other hand, it's a perfect moment for both Katara and Aang to not only have fun with each other, but to deepen their feelings for each other.  This moment succeeds beautifully at both.

The new character, On Ji is hardly interesting, and neither is her bully of a boyfriend, but the presence of the kids in the Fire Nation and Aang's aspiration to ""set them free"" from the draconian, tyrannical ways of the Fire Nation are very noble.  It shows this kid has a real big heart that exceeds his age.

The bits with Zuko also provide a bit of bite to the episode, too.  Despite supposedly having everything he wanted, he's not satisfied and still plagued with guilt for his past actions.  Even so, he still has temptation to stamp out Aang, as evidenced by when he sends out who we will come to call ""Combustion Man.""

""The Headband"" is easily one of my favorite episodes from both Season Three AND the whole show.  Not something I expected to say, but it's true.  The Kataango scene is its definitive highlight, and a moment that I have always rewatched.  I just love this moment.  Flamey-O indeed."
"Review: Sorry my comment is not as thoughtful as everyone else's, but seriously as a lady who (has been pregnant) and still wants to dress up, there are seriously not enough fabulous costumes as Sapphire Fire. 💕 Thanks Katara!"
"Review: This episode is a great introduction to Fire Nation culture and norms. Sure, we’ve spent plenty of time with Zuko, Azula, Iroh and the Fire Nation soldiers. But there’s something to be said about seeing what the ordinary people of the Fire Nation are like. Also, the pop quiz scene where the teacher suggests Firelord Sozin battled the Air Nomad “army” is very revealing of Fire Nation war sentiments. There’s clearly been an active effort to spin this war as a justified and noble cause. From our perspective we understand that the war is corrupt and inherently evil. But within the Fire Nation it’s viewed as a righteous fight."
"Review: This episode is definitely one of my favorites of the show!!! The outfits are all 10/10 perfection!! I really liked Aang with hair it was good on him. Also I'll never get tired of the school yard ""fight"" or the dance scene. I watch it not often than I should hahahaaha"
"Review: This episode is one of my favorites in the entire series. The dance party scene is so vibrant and fun to watch, and it really shows the power and importance of artistic and cultural expression. I can't get enough of watching these kids letting loose and playing music and dancing to said music. 

Speaking of which, that music that plays is so energetic and mesmerizing. It goes from fun and exciting as the students are learning to dance, and intense and romantic during Aang and Katara's dance. I'm not the most intense Kataang shipper, but I really can't understate how beautiful that dance was. It really is probably one of the most romantic moments between them in the show.

I also love the chase scene when the headmaster crashes the party. It's pretty amusing how the music switches from a moderate tempo to a frantic allegro, like the Flameos were like ""Shit, Kuzon's in trouble! Shin, double-time, now!""

I got some mild ""I'm Spartacus"" vibes from when the kids all helped Aang escape by putting on their headbands to cover for him. In just a short time, through music, dance and romance, Aang successfully planted a seed of rebellion within these children. For someone like me who loves the arts and acknowledges its power throughout history, that's incredible to see."
"Review: This is a fine episode, but in my opinion on the weaker side of Avatar. In the A-plot, I like the look at fire nation school, seeing how people are indoctrinated into the culture and propaganda of the fire nation, and the lies that they tell. The whole footloose plotline is decent, with some solid comedy and lots of Kataang, but in the grand scheme of thing is primarily filler. Although, their new fire nation clothing is my favorite group of outfits of the series.

In the B-plot, Zuko returns to Iroh, lashing out in anger based on his own frustration and anguish. Iroh sees that there is nothing for him to say anymore, and that Zuko must follow a path for himself the achieve what he desires. There is some more Zuko and Mai, interrupted by Azula, followed by a heavy side-eye. Lastly, he hires a mysterious assassin to take down the avatar for good.

Overall, this episode is fun, and it adds some good world-building, its just on the lower end of the avatar spectrum for me."
Review: This my FAVORITE episode! It’s also where I got my username funny enough. I love the aspect of the Fire Nation school but I’m mainly here for the Kataango…
Review: The animation in this episode is godly. I love how flowy all of the action sequences are.
Review: Me too! I think it really suits him
"Review: I think you're maybe reading into how Zuko found an assassin too much. It's the Fire Nation in the middle of a war. I'm sure they've got a go-to guy or whatnot to take down political opponents and dissidents. I mean, look at how Ozai treated his family. I can't imagine he'd have more empathy for his dissidents. I'm sure somebody in the palace knows how to get ahold of an assassin.

&#x200B;

Or maybe I'm reading into it too much"
"Review: >>Kataango

I love this."
