"Review: Wait, who thinks it was bad?"
"Review: I love Katara centered episodes where she's just casually doing a revolution. Also her painted lady costume eats. Doc and Shu was funny. We love a lil ecoterrorism*joking for anyone wanting to report me* and ""he really does have a heart"" is a great moment. I give it a 9/10"
"Review: ATLA is such a short show, and the filler episodes are still fun to watch anyways, so I never skip any. I don't think there is a ""bad"" episode, I love the whole experience from start to end."
"Review: Wait point me to those ppl who said it was bad.

I just wanna talk."
Review: WHO DOESNT LIKE IT WHAT????
"Review: I love the eco-t*rrorism angle of this episode, unironically. It shows that sometimes the only way to make change is direct action.

It’s also a Katara episode and her very impassioned line “I will NEVER, EVER turn my back on people who need me.” That is peak Katara and I love how Mae Whitman delivered it so sincerely. It inspires me to this day."
"Review: It’s NOT a filler like some keep suggesting. It serves to illustrate that parts of the Fire Nation are suffering physically and spiritually as a consequence of the Hundred Year War as well.

(Addendum: By “filler” I’m referring to the pejorative manner in which it was used by *others* elsewhere in this post, regardless of the *actual* definition, to dismissively indicate that the episode served no purpose and was easily removable.)"
Review: bad? it was one of my favorite growing up!
Review: I hadn't heard of it being bad
Review: I like every episode tbh. Even the “worst one” which is the great divide. Even though I don’t think it’s great I can still watch it no problem and get some enjoyment out of the humor.
"Review: It’s a good episode, but given how compressed season 3 is I’d rather an episode devoted to lion turtle set up or something."
Review: One of my faves!
"Review: The episode kinda does what the episode of Aang going to school does. It building more of the world in the Fire Nation. We learn that even folks in the Fire Nation are negatively affected by the ongoing war, with a Factory dumping all its waste and other contaminants into the river that a river-town predominantly gets its food and drinking water from.

It's another episode that, again, gives Katara a moment to provide aid to another group of people she has no real connection to and did so while using an idol they worshipped as a persona."
"Review: I liked the episode too but come on guys, downvoting the people to oblivion here that say they didnt like it is sad."
"Review: I thought it was fine. The weirdest part for me is that Sokka's Master is the very next episode. So in The Painted Lady, Sokka is adamant about getting to the capital and staying on schedule and then in Sokka's Master he just takes a trip to himself to learn how to sword fight. Just an odd character shift"
Review: Until today I've never seen anyone say anything good about this episode until this post.
"Review: It's a really good episode. All the characters are well-written. The toph stumping a rock on the ground and Appa howling for the sound effect blew my mind away when I first saw it.

The characters including the village folk were very reasonable. Aang telling Katara ""nah, I think you're a hero"" when he found out Katara poisoned Appa (we dont know if it was really poison though) was an absolute bro move. Very nice moment I enjoyed."
Review: I dislike this episode just cause the fish and the water actually disgusts me and I find it hard to watch lol
"Review: Not a bad episode, but it being a filler episode contributed to the latter half of Book 3 being a little rushed. This episode and the Nightmares and Daydreams episode had good characterization, but I feel like they should’ve combined them into other episodes or just not have them in favor of more episodes to flesh out Zuko’s integration into the group, and the conflict with Katara."
"Review: I don't think it's bad, but I do think it's the worst episode since at *least* Season 1 Episode 17 (The Northern Air Temple).

That's quite a high bar though."
"Review: Ok but hear me out: it's probably the weakest episode of season 3. If I could trade this episode for another one post zukos joining the gang, I wouldnt even blink"
"Review: why is the comment section larping like this was a good episode? half of the things people here are praising it for are not real or not good enough reasons to overshadow the horrible parts of the episode.  
  
the pacing was horrible, the conflict went no where and the writers showed off how badly they can butcher katara by making her ""womanly nurturing and protective"" desires overshadow her logic and common sense

the only thing we learn is that the fire nations imperialism can hurt its own citizens, which we learned in other episodes..."
Review: After NATLA even the Canyon is a masterpiece
Review: [deleted]
"Review: It's not a bad episode. I don't think there are any bad episodes of ATLA. However, I do think it's atleast a bottom 5 episode of ATLA. I think it rivals great divide for thar bottom spot, but I'll admit that some people love this episode.


Honestly I like the concepts of the episode a lot, but the execution wasn't great."
Review: The painted lady was meh
"Review: I think the only part that sucks is ending because they revealed that Painted Lady is really does exist but doesn't do shit to help those people and problem with that is when Katara met her, she said nothing like: ""Where the fuck have you been all this time? "" and instead she respected PL in a weird way."
Review: I rank this episode lower than the Great Divide.
Review: It’s ok. Just a little boring.
Review: But it is a heavy handed moralising episode.
Review: Still a filler
"Review: I love that episode, I just wish I could find the song that they play when cleaning the river on Spotify, it’s so twangy, I love it"
Review: It's one of my favorites. The creativity in creating the painted lady character was a perfect plan. Really great episode?
Review: Overanalyzing Avatar.
"Review: I kinda do. 

The Katara stuff works great, but God the Doc/Shu stuff is just unbearable. I normally love ATLA's comedy but that bit just doesn't land and they quadruple down on it"
Review: Nostalgia critic
"Review: It's pretty bad. Sokka's an asshole for no reason, most of the humor doesn't hit (imo), the schedule thing pops up here and just about never again, and the whole episode is basically Imprisoned Book 3 Edition.

There are good themes (Fire Nation hurting its own citizens, etc), but they had been or would be explored at some point and the execution is really clunky. There were other things and characters they could've expanded on at that point in the series instead."
"Review: I do, basically all the points overanalyzing avatar made I agree with"
"Review: Huh, I guess she does do that here and the prison. Two nickels, weird that it happened twice."
"Review: Honestly the ""filler episodes"" don't really feel like filler to me. They used those episodes to expand on the characters and their growth, giving them more depth.  Even if they don't really drive the plot, they still give us valuable insights into why the characters act the way they do."
"Review: Even ""The Great Divide""?"
Review: [Here](https://youtu.be/WIRJ73CUKTA?si=GBHFuJH5AU5aCxTo)
Review: it’s one of my favorites i think it’s definitely top 10 FUNNIEST episodes
Review: I think it’s pretty much one of the weakest episodes and agree with the points overanalyzing avatar makes
Review: Totally agree. I love Katara in this episode.
Review: A “filler” episode only means that the central plot isn’t advanced. It doesn’t mean that there isn’t storytelling related to the central plot.
"Review: Filler episodes can include characterization and character development. Filler doesn’t mean “bad episode”, it just means that it doesn’t progress the central plot. Which is true for The Painted Lady."
Review: I'm not only one who's doesn't like The Northern Air Temple?  I think it's decent I just get bored watching it and I can never put my finger on why.  
"Review: Most of the posting members of the ATLA sub are convinced that the original cartoon is a literal 11/10 show. Not only is it perfect in every conceivable way, but the show runners thoughts out every detail down to the fact that Katara doesn’t like papaya. Isn’t that dedication? You can’t criticize the first show, but you can criticize everything else avatar adjacent."
"Review: Hey, Nightmares and Daydreams is a great episode and I stand by it!

That being said, I do agree The Painted Lady is the worst of Season 2/3, but that's just by default because they are simply such consistently strong seasons. And in comparison, The Painted Lady is just fine."
"Review: I don't think it's bottom 5 for the whole show, but I do think it's bottom 5 for episodes after Season 1. If you include Season 1, there are at least several others I'd consider worse.

EDIT: Looking back at my ratings for each episode, The Painted Lady might actually just *barely* crack bottom 5 for the show for me. But if it does, it's close. And I still think it's a fine episode."
Review: My understanding of the ending was that the painted lady couldn’t help because the water was so polluted. That’s why she says thank you to Katara.
Review: There cannot be filler in source material. Filler is when an adaptation of the source material adds non-canon plotlines that were not in the source material.
"Review: I wasn't a fan either. It's a filler episode that doesn't do much for characterization and it's too simplistic. It also has some of the most anachronistic technology with the Jet Skis and factory that's way too advanced for the world. I don't mind that Avatar has Steam Punk elements but there's a line between basic bending powered machines (Earth Kingdom trains, war balloons, ships) and straight up modern technology and these just didn't need to be part of the world. If the Fire Nation can utilize factories and hydro power at this scale it would make no sense for everyone to still be living in medieval times across their whole kingdom. 


Overall the episode adds nothing to the story, we already got stories about Katara's heart being in the right place so it wasn't growth for her either. At least with The Great Divide that's the first episode we get of Aang being a leader and find his own way of solving problems between feuding tribes. It's the first time we get to see Aang being the Avatar and it's a good glimpse into who he would become down the road. Painted Lady could be removed and we'd lose nothing but clean up the world building quite a bit."
"Review: I just rewatched the episode last night and always interpreted it as Sokka is just a feller who’s stressed to smithereens, they’ve only got so much time to make it to the fire nation and he’s just tryna manage them kids 😭"
Review: wtf???
Review: you forgot the haru episode in season 1
"Review: Especially ""The Great Divide""."
Review: [removed]
Review: 😐
"Review: I think it's not complex than that. Lots of episodes in season 1 don't advance the central plot at all, but also aren't really filler.

I think it would be more accurate to say ""if you skip the episode, nothing is missing from the series"". Like Imprisoned doesn't advance the plot at all, but if you skip it then Haru comes out of fucking nowhere during the invasion"
"Review: to add to this, many fillers serve the plot to some extent, serving to advancing or further detailing your characters’ motivations, flaws and soul. even one-off ones usually do this sort of thing."
Review: no filler is literally episodes added to pad runtime when the show is catching up with its source and therefore cant have any impact on the plot
"Review: Filler is a slang term and that is not an agreed upon definition. Many, including me, would argue filler means an episode that exists for nothing more than to fill up the runtime. Something you can skip without missing anything. The Painted Lady doesn’t fall into that."
"Review: Oh I don't think it's a *bad* episode, but it's literally the last episode before Painted Lady that I think can even compete with it. Avatar Day is an episode a lot of people seem to dislike or be meh on, but I'm a *big* defender of it. The entire Iroh/Zuko thing going on is great, and the main plot is both hilarious and then surprisingly super insightful about Kyoshi.

So you go back in time to S1, but Eps 18-20 are awesome, and 17 is the next up haha."
"Review: Idk, most of my bottom 5 is made up of season 1 episodes anyway. If we're only looking at book 2 and book 3, I honestly can't think of an episode that's worse than painted lady."
Review: [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler). You're using the anime fandom definition which isn't the only kind of filler
Review: Filler episode can mean an episode that pads out a season without advancing the plot
"Review: Filler is also when they make a story that’s irrelevant to the season and makes no lasting impact on the show, which makes it basically a pointless waste of time."
"Review: I mean, the Fire Nation have a literal giant drill and tanks. Those have to come from somewhere. The idea that Fire Nation is having an industrial revolution during the war while other nations have to rely on bending alone work."
"Review: But then why is this the ONLY episode he's stressing about that? If it were a throughline it could work, but it really isn't, this is basically the only time the schedule comes up and that Sokka is so stressed about it. Yall can downvote but seems you can’t answer lol."
Review: True. That one went... Less well. Guess she learned over time.
Review: The reason people don't like The Great Divide is because it is so self contained. It really doesn't move the main story along so it got rerun the most on Nickelodeon. It's definitely the episode I've seen the most on cable.
"Review: I love the great divide, Aang lying at the end has always made me lose it."
"Review: It's a good channel, but his take on this episode was psychotic."
"Review: He’s actually the best Avatar content creator I’ve ever come across.

Give him a chance, watch his other stuff."

"Review: >Fire Nation’s imperialism and over-industrialization negatively affected its own citizens??

Honestly I really don't like this. Every other fire nation city seems really happy and they have good life. If it wanted to that way for only that island make it Earth Nation city that got invaded."
"Review: > Anyway, I’m sorry but do they not realize that aside from Katara’s growth

What growth? She plays essentially the same role as she does in Imprisoned. 

> Anyway, I’m sorry but do they not realize that aside from Katara’s growth this episode showed how Fire Nation’s imperialism and over-industrialization negatively affected its own citizens??

Sure, that's *a* thing the episode did. But... why is this important? The Fire Nation has done plenty of bad stuff throughout the show, is it really necessary to dedicate a whole episode to them beating up on their own citizens too? We already got the point. Maybe there's a stronger argument, but you haven't made it

> We won’t have any Painted Lady slander here.

Since when is having an opinion on an episode ""slander?"" You're the one insulting others for cheap points."
"Review: it basically repeats the imprisoned plot line, sokka is uncharacteristic in that episode with him not wanting to help anyone, appa is swimming in sludge for 0 reason (ik he fakes being sick but this was just stupid imo), the fight scene is mid (it has random slow motion shots that dont really make sense), and the dock keeper humor just didnt do it for me. 

The only good things I enjoyed were the episode showing that the war effort also negatively affected the fire nation (something not previously explored)"
Review: The term filler existed before anime lol
"Review: I mean, you *can* skip The Painted Lady without missing anything integral to the overarching plot. That’s my point."
"Review: I need to be nicer to it because it brings good real world scenarios of historical sites being messed with an people making morally wrong decisions in war for the sake of their family, but I think I'm always ready to jump to Siege of the North on rewatches so I'm worn down by then.  
I will say it checks the boxes for episodes that initially aren't great to me but may become a favorite after rewatching over and over again.  It's a common occurrence for me for my least favorite to become one of my favorites."
"Review: Yep exactly, I would agree with that. When I did a rewatch a few years ago and gave each episode a gut check rating, The Painted Lady got a 6/10 for me and aside from it, not a single episode from Season 2 onward got below an 8/10 (except Avatar Day, for which I was swimming between 7 and 8)."
"Review: No it isn't, you made that up."
"Review: That's the thing though, they're not in an industrial revolution. We get to see multiple Fire Nation towns and how the very highest elites in the Fire Nation lives and there's not a single sign of industrialization anywhere. They're still living just as medieval lives as the Earth Kingdom without even the most rudimentary technological advancements you'd expect from an industrialized country. 




The drill is fine (big but relatively simple machine that can be powered by bending) while the tanks are a little too modern they don't hold a candle to those stupid jet skis that shouldn't exist at all. Bryke did a really good job with the world building but when it comes to Fire Nation technology they don't really do much to blend it in. It would make sense for the Fire Nation to be more advanced as a whole but they didn't go that route so the random nuts of technology sticks out like a sore thumb."
Review: That speaks more to the flaws of Book 3 as a whole rather than the episode itself.
"Review: This, this right here is what colored so many people's view of The Great Divide so negatively."
"Review: Nah man it's just the ending. The way Aang solves the two tribes' problems is a bit... out of character... I always assumed it was because they ran out of episode time.

Aside from that both episodes are pretty good."
"Review: Yup, this is the only reason I’m not that fond of it is because it was played to death."
"Review: One we don’t see every city obviously because that’d be absurd.  Two most the positive fire city moments are for our royals and the wealthy kids they interact with.

Three imperialist issues do raise their head in the headband episode as well, just in a more indirect way.  It’s also fairly safe to assume the kids Aang goes to school with are also in the upper crust of society.

We really don’t spend a ton of time in the fire nation in general.  But the looks we get are the royals/nobles class (beach episode), upper middle class or lower nobles (school episode), the poor (painted lady episode).

How do we think the lives the cart lifters are, these just are things the show doesn’t go into."
Review: You can’t generalize every city based on the experiences of one. That isn’t just a thing with the show it’s common sense like the real world
"Review: I'd argue it's different while still expanding upon her role as a caretaker and protector. 


In imprisoned, she has some responsibility in Haru being found out and taken away. This is what leads the team to go and rescue him, and subsequently the others. She doesn't even try to fight the prison guards herself, she simply inspires Haru which leads to everyone fighting back. This episode was about Katara's value in hope and her ability to inspire it in others. 


The Painted Lady is about her taking action into her own hands. She isn't responsible for any of these people or their conditions, her only accountability comes at the end when she refuses to leave when the soldiers try to take revenge and the team convinces the village to clean the river. At this point in her story though, she probably would've protected and helped them even if she wasn't responsible for the factory explosion. This episode is about her fierceness and desire to make a difference. It's not so much about hope or inspiration in this episode, it's more about taking action. This is highlighted when Katara yells that she will never abandon people that need her, it emphasizes her care for the helpless and determination to help even if she has to do it in disguise and lie to her team.  


Both episodes highlight similar aspects of her personality and values, but that development from taking action to inspire others to taking action to directly make a difference expands upon Katara's journey through the show. The fierceness of her character and her determination grows along with her skills and waterbending prowess. 


Also the fire nation industrialization effects are important for the world building. It not only showcases that the fire nation's war having a negative effect on its own citizens, but the war's effects on nature. That was always a big theme for the show, as the world being out of balance was both physically and spiritually. There's plenty of evidence of how the fire nation affected the rest of the world, this episode is how it affects the people and land within the fire nation. 


I personally liked seeing the subtle changes in her character, especially since the two episodes are two seasons apart. It was a nice way to integrate the effects of the fire nation industrialization, fire nation spirit culture, and Katara's personal journey.


It's fine if people don't like it for whatever reasons, but it's not a pointless episode. It's growing on themes and characterization that's been layered throughout each season."
"Review: respectfully, i disagree entirely 🙏"
Review: Did not. Have you watched The Flash? There are complaints about filler episodes.
Review: If you deleted this episode it would have zero impact on the series. It's not even notable as a meme. 
Review: I didn't mean to say imperialism of fire nation is good lol. But I don't understand why you think the school aang goes to is upper class. If aang can join (they showed gaang is rather poor maybe not after Toph though but we don't know that) it most common every day school.
"Review: Fair enough, what do you like about it if I may ask?"
"Review: Plenty of people make nonsensical complaints. All of them are from people, like you, who heard the term ""filler"" and made up a definition in your head which is not the actual definition of the word."
"Review: i love all the humor, i think sokka showing he doesn’t want to help the people because he wants to focus on helping take down the fire nation entirely is valid and i think if it weren’t for his character we wouldn’t get the foil of katara’s speech of how she will never turn her back on people that need her help. altogether i think it’s a very enjoyable episode"
Review: That’s just you who thinks so
"Review: My biggest problem is one of the central conflicts of the episode is some extremely tight schedule Sokka has calculated. At the conclusion of this episode they are even further behind schedule but not only is it never mentioned again, Sokka sees fit to spend a day studying sword play *immediately* after."
"Review: No mate, literally everyone thinks so. You can’t just call episodes that you don’t have the attention for filler because you have ADHD."
Review: [deleted]
"Review: Filler episodes are entries in a generally continuous serial that are unrelated to the main plot, don't significantly alter the relations between the characters, and generally serve only to take up space."
"Review: Tell that to every person who has ever complained about a filler episode, that wasn’t anime"
Review: Nope. You literally just made that up. They are episodes used to FILL time for the manga to catch up.
Review: I never got why people say it's bad.
Review: I didn't know people disliked the episode. I really liked it!
Review: If these are the poll results who the fuck is 'people'
Review: Do people say it's bad?
Review: Literally the only person I’ve seen dislike it is overanalysing avatar. Sure the slow mo was a bit unnecessary but overall I think it was very enjoyable
Review: Overanalyzing Avatar just has a weird hate boner for it.
"Review: What? Who says that? It showed us a lot about Katara and the extent she goes to help people even if it meant harm to herself. just because the episode isn't all about aang doesn't mean it's bad. Sure it didn't do anything to the plot, but it establishes that aang and gang go around every place and help people."
Review: I actually liked it ;-;
Review: one of my favorite episodes
Review: There’s no such thing as bad Avatar episodes just ones that aren’t as good as others. Except maybe the great divide.
Review: It's just an okay episode. It's no Zuko Alone but it's no Great Divide either.
"Review: I realized that season 3 focused a lot on character depth, but the Painted Lady I think was a good episode regardless of if it moved the plot or not."
"Review: it’s my least favorite filler episode, but being compared to how good ATLA filler episodes are, it doesn’t mean that Painted Lady was a bad one."
Review: Hearing people say they didn’t like it gave me whiplash. It’s one of the few episodes I remembered from when I was a kid and it was one of my favorites on rewatching
Review: i loved the episode and didn’t know it was notoriously hated until i watched an atla episode ranking on youtube!
Review: No it’s just weak compared to Season 2 and Season it’s still better than episodes like the Fortune Teller in Season 1
Review: People say its bad?
"Review: It’s a pretty good episode, actually. I’m not sure why it gets so much hate, even if it is “filler”."
"Review: It's a minor side bump that kinda does extra worldbuilding and character building/developing or reminder that while they're fighting the Fire Nation, the kids can somewhat acknowledge that even some of the civilians (presuming the people on the river are Fire Nation) are greatly affected negatively to the constant industrialization of the lands and prioritizing colonization over all us.

It's also an episode that's kinda obvious we'd never hear about again in the future. Comet is coming, Fire Nation continues to advance in their plans/efforts to destroy the world and bend it into their new ""image."" But Katara needed to pretend to be a spirit that had since abandoned the river town for a couple of days and it does not at all complicate their plans to find Aang a firebending teacher and get it mastered as quickly as possible.

The Great Divide is still lower than this episode to me. While being the first filler episode, its worldbuilding is NEVER brought up again. We know there's multiple groups of people displaced by the Fire Nation and seek Ba Sing Se as their only known ""shelter"" with literal walls and sense of security and safety. There are a bunch of different paths that the Fire Nation supposedly never find and/or are very dangerous to trepress across without the wildlife or the terrain leaving you vulnerable to an untimely and unexpected demise.

This episode established that there's exactly ONE elder earthbender that knows enough about the canyon to climb into its lowest depths and allow safe passage to the city with no issue. Even had Appa take some of the sick and elderly ahead of the abled-bodied, healthy, and younger members of the travelers. However, with these particular two groups, the earthbender being injured by the fauna in the region, and one night where both broke the food rule and being petty about it, everyone just climb out of the canyon, the Gaang move on, and no other earthbender or civilian within the Earth Kingdom ever comes across this region, tried to somehow construct some form of anti-fauna passage or map out routes least likely to get people killed, and Aang managed to squash a clan feud that lasted CENTURIES by going ""it was just a game!""

The Great Divide was a weird filler. I can't even say it added anything to the characters. We already knew Katara and Sokka understandably view the world differently from each other. If someone was to tweaked the clans, it could even be your standard ""boys vs. girl"" storyline that a few comedic shows throw in. The Painted Lady was more a little moment for Katara to do another act of heroism."
"Review: Its a fun episode. However it doesn't accomplish much, if anything in terms of build up, characters or lore.

I liked it, but would have much preferred like an Ozai backstory episode for example which would enhance the character drastically and provide higher stakes to the plot"
"Review: its not my favorite, i dont dislike any episode of avatar, even the great divide. but id consider this to be one of the weakest episodes in the show"
"Review: The design for the painted lady spirit is nice, but that's the only good thing from this episode I can think of. It's just a retread of what we know about Katara, that she sticks up for people, which we've seen plenty of times before, there's no need to cover it again.

 It's like if there was another episode of Aang helping out animals like he did in Tales of Ba Sing Se, like duh we know he loves animals and Appa why do we need to cover this again? I'd have replaced it with an episode that explores Azula's thoughts and feelings, or maybe that Iroh backstory episode that was cut.

Also Dock and Shu and the other personality isn't funny."
"Review: For me it’s the giant plot hole: 

Sokka is obsessed about the planning. 1 day of delay would make it so the piss and eat times would be simultaneously to make up for the lost time.

But we know from the later episode that they arrive 3 DAYS too early (daydreams and nightmares). So how the fuck did they manage that?? They would have to eat and piss on Appa"
"Review: I can't stand it personally, but everyone has their own opinions."
Review: Overall it’s a fine episode but ATLA sets a super high bar which makes it look bad in comparison to the rest of the series
Review: No but it's kind of like the Great Divide where you know it's filler and if you skip it you won't lose anything in the long run
"Review: It's one of those episodes where it doesn't further the plot at all and isn't referenced again. It's not Great Divide bad but it also isn't necessary and could have been used to tell a different story. Very much just a filler episode. Personally, I would have replaced it with an episode about Iroh in prison and maybe have flashbacks about him and his son."
"Review: This is not a popular opinion, but for me there are a few times in the series where I’m very starkly reminded that this show is marketed for young kids.

The episode-long joke of Shu and his brothers is one of those times. All Bumi scenes are another. I don’t enjoy the kind of jokes that these characters present, and actually find them annoying. So for me these are the worst episodes because they totally shatter engagement with the world while they are on screen.

Thankfully there aren’t very many moments like this, and I like the rest of the episode."
Review: It's the worst episode of Season 3 and a complete waste of time. And before anyone mentions Nightmares and Daydreams at least that episode has an important Zuko B plot. Edit: As usual ATLA fans can't handle the fact that their show isn't perfect and has mediocre to even bad episodes.
"Review: I need to rewatch the series, it's been a while so I don't remember what happened, but I also don't know the episode names"
Review: I can understand why some people didn’t like and I can understand why some people do .
"Review: It's not great, but could be worse. Nightmares episode is worse."
Review: It’s solid filler
"Review: It's middling filler. Not particularly bad, not particularly good, but in a season that ends up feeling rush and compressed by the end it wasn't needed."
"Review: Wait, people are saying that is a bad episode?!"
Review: i actually love that episode so much
Review: Not even close to the worst episode
Review: I thought it was kinda cliche but overall a solid episode. Nothing stands out as being particularly bad.
"Review: Wait people dont like it ? Sure it kinda feels fillerish but really ? ""Bad"" ?"
"Review: People don’t say it was bad, so the original question sucks."
"Review: It’s not bad it’s just a filler episode though  
(I guess you could say it’s an episode to show kataras something )"
Review: I am dumb I clicked yes instead of no
Review: Nah... It shows how big Katara's heart is.
"Review: I personally think there was a little more potential the actual Painted Lady to be involved in the plot of the episode, but other than that it's a perfectly fine episode."
Review: Season 3 filler episodes are much better then season 1 filler; sorry random firenation enslavement camp in the water
"Review: It’s important to realize a lot of people are cringe. They can have their opinions, but I don’t have to recognize them when they are bad."
"Review: It's a good episode, but the timing was bad.

It would fit better with book 1 or 2"
"Review: I really hate the part where Aang was airbending mud at his friends, he would never do that to his friends. Of course, he might have sneezed at Toph and her parents purposely, but that was just a joke and a small revenge towards Toph, but airbending mud is totally out of character to me. Why did he swim in muddy water anyway?"
"Review: Again, who would say yes?! I’ve already said it, but we see her have a great emotional development here. It shows a passionate side of her and how far she’s willing to go to help others, even it means lying to her family. And the stark contrast to the Southern Raiders, we see how that side of her has a dark side to it. And how she uses how she handles her situation with her family is something that you’d never expect from her, but everyone is full of surprises!"
"Review: It's kinda boring and Katara acts selfish, overall an extremely unnecessary episode and there's no Zuko B-Plot to at least feel some level of progression.

Feels like an S1 episode (except with all the things that make Book 3 good)"
Review: I understand why others liked this episode but I personally did not. Not just because of overanalyzing avatar even the first time I just couldn't dig it. I was shocked to find a YouTuber who agreed actually with the episode feeling like it was written completely differently from the rest of the story. That is just my personal opinion though and the character development and humanizing the citizens of the fire nation were great but just not my cup of tea lol
"Review: Honestly its actually one of the best episodes. Arguably this episode could actually make for a spectacular feature film in my opinion. You have the making of a really good thriller mixed in with a lot of real world poverty and corruption. Personally speaking this is my favorite episode. It shows that you dont have to be the “chosen one” like the actual avatar, but still have a heart and will just as strong to make an impactful difference."
"Review: Because Overanalyzing Avatar hates it and has talked at length about how much he hates hit, and a lot of people in this fandom have seen his videos."
Review: It’s not directly related to the fight against the Fire Nation.
Review: To me it's saying when you're poor you have to help yourself.... Doesn't work like that and kinda racist to people in that same situation.
Review: It’s one of my favorites from season 3! It’s an important episode for Katara’s character development in contrast to the southern raiders
Review: I was surprised to find out people disliked it as well.
Review: Overanalyzing Avatar
Review: There exist others outside the subreddit
Review: Other fans
"Review: I also think the episode highlights another important aspect that tends to be overlooked (much like in the same vain that The Headband tends to be overlooked and seen as “filler”) which is that it shows how much the Fire Nation hurts its own citizens in the war just as much as the other nations and what they are suffering through. The people living by the Jang Hui river are regular, lower class Fire Nation citizens who don’t have the proper resources and necessities for survival and families are struggling having to look out for each other (for example, the little boy Katara helps and sees him run to his mom who is ill)."
"Review: That was all established in book 1 tho. That's pretty much what the point of episodes like ""Imprisoned"" was. We already know the lengths Katara and the gang goes to to help people, so an episode like this isn't necessary this far into the series. I think that's what alot of people's problem with it is. Plus there are plenty of episodes that ""aren't about Aang"" and are still great; that's not the issue. And to be clear, I don't hate this episode; but it would be pretty far down on my rewatch list."
"Review: The great divide I think was a true filler episode. Even in the ember island play, it’s acknowledged as unimportant lol. I still liked it, just not as much as the rest of the show"
Review: Even that is a bit overhated honestly.
Review: One popular avatar youtuber says it is bad
"Review: i disagree that in doesn’t accomplish anything in terms of characters or lore. it shows how much harm the fire nation does even to it’s own citizens, and it also focuses a lot on katara as a character and how much she is willing to do to help people. i also love the end of the episode- very realistic. It is filler in regards to the overarching story so i kinda get why people don’t like it but i do think it has its merits"
"Review: The Painted Lady episode humanizes citizens of the fire nation. Even fire nation citizens are neglected, mistreated, bullied, forgotten about to fend for themselves. It's more than just Katara caring for people..."
"Review: This is just crazy to me. 

Did you just want there to be 1 episode for each topic? Before the win? So 5 episodes then done?"
Review: That's a weird reason to dislike the episode
Review: Or maybe they miscalculated
"Review: Hmmm, but they had plenty of time for Sokka to learn to use a sword for at least 2 days. I'm not sure and I don't really care thinking about how they arrived early.

Painted Lady is a great episode."
Review: Happy cake day!
Review: Except that the Fire Nation neglects and bullies their own citizens. This is what we learn from the Painted Lady episode. It's not really filler. The Fire Nation only cares about the citizens who benefit their nation keeping it running and making them richer. The rest of the citizens can get sick and die for all they care.
Review: I mean… you could just skip to the ending if that’s your criteria.
Review: It's not filler though. Character development and worldbuilding are just as important as the main plot.
Review: It’s the one with the painted lady. /s
"Review: It isn’t *pure* filler, though. For the first time, it shows that the fire nation doesn’t even care about their citizens. Like, they could get sick and die for all they care, all that matters is that the village keeps on giving the fire nation what they want.

And it also shows how far Katara goes to help people that need it."
"Review: I think it makes something that some of the episodes of the Clone Wars did from time to time. It humanized the citizens of the Fire Nation, like those in the Clone Wars did with the Separatists. Granted, the headband did that already, but in the Painted Lady showed the destruction that The Fire Nation inflicted to its people and it's land too."
Review: It is though. It's showing how the citizens of the fire nation are affected by the war.
"Review: The fight against the Fire Nation, just like any authoritarian governments, is fought on multiple fronts. You aren't just fighting the Fire Nation's army, you are also fighting it's corrupt propaganda and human rights abuses.

Obviously defeating the army is important to protect the world, but if you neglect the second half the country that rises from the previously regime's ashes will be no better."
"Review: Yup, its filler. But that shouldn't immediately make it bad"
"Review: I don't know if racist is the word, but I see your point. Yeah. And coming from the most powerful people in the world, that's rich."
Review: Me too!
Review: Yeah but what about the rest of the fire nation towns we see? They all seem fine to me
Review: People more say that they want grey stuff rather than actual wanting it. That’s why those episodes are seen as “filler”.
Review: Honestly I just think the ending was a bit…uncharacteristic and iffy in regards to the lesson of the episode. It still has the characters I like interacting with each other so that’s something.
"Review: This one rinky dink shantytown isolated from the rest of the Fire Nation isn't emblematic of all Fire Nation citizens. If the pollution was affecting more people in actual towns, like via smog or smoke then it would be much more compelling and reinforce the message ""forced industrialization is bad on large groups of people"". Your description matches the episode about Haru's village, which is a much better version of what this episode was trying to do, given that it was a Fire Nation occupied village."
"Review: Excuse me? I think you're responding to someone else man. Nowhere do I mention a ""win""."
Review: The episode contradicting the plot line of every other episode in the season isn’t a good reason to dislike the episode?
Review: I still laugh at how fast it took for Sokka to make a sword when it's common knowledge that it takes several weeks to make one.
Review: That’s actually something I’ve never thought about before…
"Review: Just because its filler doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. Goku and Piccolo driving is one of my favorite episodes of Dragon Ball ever and that shit is the definition of filler. 

And I couldn't really skip the rest of the series because as far as I know almost every episode is essential after that except for maybe ""The Ember Island Players"" because it's literally just a recap episode but that episode is great but everything else is pretty essential. If I skip to the end without knowing the show already I'd be confused af why Zuko is with the good guys, how Sokka has a sword and is competent with it, who piandao is, where Ty Lee and Mai went and more and even if I did I'd be missing a lot of character development."
"Review: Yeah but the series wouldn’t change if you skipped that episode. It’s good filler don’t get me wrong, but there isn’t any plot relevant points in it."
"Review: To add to this, I believe The Headband and The Painted Lady both show how the Fire Nation hurts its own citizens in the war just as much as the other nations and what they suffer through (but show it in different ways). For The Headband, the children in the Fire Nation schools are taught lies about their history, taught propaganda, don’t know how to have fun and are stripped away their creativity. The kids at the school get along with Aang just fine and the regular citizens around there (Fire Fountain City/North Chung Ling) also are fine. For The Painted Lady, the suffering of the regular Fire Nation citizens in the war is shown differently here in which the lower class citizens living by the Jang Hui river don’t have the proper essential resources for survival, are not being looked over by the higher class of their nation, and are having to be on their own in the war with families struggling to look out for each other (for example, the little boy Katara helped running to his mom who is ill)."
Review: The context of the headband and painted lady was different. The headband was showing school children while painted lady showed villagers.
Review: Bold of you to assume that people even want a new country to be born from the ashes.
Review: Good luck trying to get that point across.
Review: How do you know the pollution wasn't effecting more people? There are probably other villages that use that same water supply. You can't base this on the little bit the story tellers tell us.
Review: [removed]
"Review: A lot in Avatar doesn't make sense, like how did Katara essentially become a master within what was at most two weeks in the water tribe? It's a plot hole, but not an especially egregious one, especially since this episode has a very self contained story. Nobody writes off Home Alone 2 regarding Kevin's age not lining up with how many years have passed between the two films, sure it's a plot hole but that's an insignificant thing that doesn't really effect the story. I don't understand how it really hurts anything"
Review: Forged in Fire would beg to differ lol
"Review: Honestly the timeline of avatar in general is weird. Katara becomes a master waterbender in a couple of weeks. It's implied that Sokka was away for a good amount of time, yet he was only gone for less than a day."
"Review: I'd consider the worst outcome of any War to be destroying one side completely, even if that side was the aggressor in the conflict."
"Review: Because it's only this little shantytown far removed from any major population centers, no other places of importance or other people are mentioned as being affected. We're told that it's affecting this one village, we neither see or are told it's hurting other people."
Review: [removed]
"Review: Realistically, many people in-universe don’t care. It’s like being concerned about the guy that broke into your house and threatened your family."
"Review: Also, it’s literally the only town we see that was negatively affected that way. Every other town was  fine."
Review: [removed]
"Review: As written the writers do care, else we wouldn't have had Zuko's character arc end with him becoming the new Firelord and leading an era of peace and they wouldn't continue to substantiate this change in the comics and Legend of Korra. 

If you don't care that's fine, I'm not even sure what you're trying to advocate for here."
Review: My point is that you’re speaking from an outsider perspective. It’s not really a disagreement; just a reassessment as to why these sorts of things are often easier said than done.
