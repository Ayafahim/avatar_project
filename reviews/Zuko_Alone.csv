Review
"Review: So imagine you live in a little Polish town in 1940. 

Things aren’t going well, people are impoverished or starving. Germany is to blame. Then some random dude shows up and does not horrible things. Then you learn that this dude is the literal son of Hitler. 

Banishment seems like a light sentence."
"Review: I understand where you are coming from, but consider it this way. The Earthbenders were among the most recently and perhaps most horrendously oppressed of the nations, by the Fire Nation. Given the sheer usefulness and necessity of Earthbending, they became slaves in factories and were brutalized to help produce their iron warships and other machines of war.

Zuko revealing himself to be a firebender was meant to demonstrate to him something he was in denial of; in is conversation with Ozai, he remarks what a glorious lie it all was, depicting them as the saviours of a savage world. In actuality, Zuko realized he was to the Earth Kingdom what Hitler Youth/Nazis were to the Jewish people. We as viewers know that Zuko is not guilty of his father's machinations, but they do not. They see a capable fighter, wielding fire, which likely was the way many of their loved ones were killed or put in chains. They had every reason to hate Zuko, because the wounds were still fresh. This is largely what leads Zuko to man up and embrace Iroh's lessons on unity over conquest, as he realized that they had every reason to hate him and his people. It was Zuko's personal choice to spend his life correcting those atrocities, so that people like that family could trust the Fire Nation again.

So while it hurt to see, Zuko needed that lesson. Everything is connected and whether right or wrong, we bear the blood of the banners we rally behind."
Review: He’s literally hitler’s son
"Review: >  other than be a wanted man inside their village

Uh, that's enough motive for exile."
"Review: You said it yourself, that village has reasons to hate Zuko. And no one own Zuko anything.

I am more surprised that nobody decided to kill Zuko on the spot. I think the entire villain would have even teamed up with the earthbending soldiers to fight against him.

Besides, not many in the village actually cares about Zuko before revealing his identity. Only the family of the farm, which I should mention, potentionally lost their older son and the father when on a dengerous mission to find him, all because of the war the Fire Nation casued, the war Zuko's blood line started.

It's actually a very important moment of self-reflection from Zuko, up to this point in the series, Zuko always had self doubt and low self esteem and usually scream about how he has it worse than anyone else, fighting the earthbenders make him believe and valuable himself, he remembered who he is and shout it out with pride, reafirming himself that he Prince of the Fire Nation.

Only for that moment of pride to be entirely crushed to the ground when the village didnt started to vow at him, but hated him and then told him that he most be a dishonored Prince, not only did they called him trash for who Zuko is, but calling him worse than trash.

A consistent theme in Zuko's arc is for him to realize that his pain is not special, right when he started to angst about his scar, Song show him her scar caused by an attack from Fire Bender, when Zuko was starving, he found a couple with food and before he planned to steal from them he noticed that the woman was pregnat, which mean they also needed the food, when he was missing Lu Ten who was like a brother figure for him, to kid from the villain went to him about his older brother being kidnapted by Fire Benders. When he started to miss mother, he found Katara who mother was killed by the Fire Nation.

Zuko's feeling of pain is valid but the show is clearly reminding the viewers the drastically different and privilaged position Zuko is as the Prince of the Fire Nation and his position of his war compared to everyone else who is suffering because of it and that he has the power to end it.

Destiny even give him in a silver plate the chance to stop all this suffering back in Ba Sing Se, and even the chance to eliminate his scar, and he fucked up, backstabbed literally everyone who was ever nice to him, and after getting what he wanted at the expence of everyone's happiness, he realized how trully awful he was and decided to stop it. And he also started to just accept that people hate him for very genuine reasons and all he can do about it is fix it or make it up for it

The village hating him was very much important for Zuko and the village is entirely justify to not give Zuko any sympathy, they have suffered more then Zuko did."
"Review: Eh, it’s a human and realistic response. The fire nation has, and is currently fucking everyone over. Their lives are worse and they’ve all lost loved ones because of the fire nation. The family zuko helped just lost their son to the same nation zuko just proudly delclared himself the prince of, which from their view shows he’s still with completely on their side, regardless of how he’s helped.

Imagine being a Jew during the Holocaust and the son of hitler just up. Would You really expect them to brush away all hate and pain cause he helped out for a day? It’s a miracle they didnt try to kill him right there. But it’s what really makes the episode so great"
"Review: Ironically, I feel like your rant displays the same lack of nuance you’re attributing to the village. 

Maybe, a more meaningful takeaway other than “what they did is wrong” vs “what they did is right” is that war is complicated, and that means it causes complicated situations where people do complicated things. Like you said, there’s an explanation for why they cast Zuko out: he’s the son of a tyrant who’s caused them and the world immense suffering. There’s no easy answer. I feel like going “man fuck those guys” just conveys as a narrow view of what they must have been experiencing"
"Review: The point isn't to consider them good people, the point is to demonstrate how the horror of 100 years of war have created a harsh division between the bending nations. If you don't like them, you aren't really supposed to."
Review: The biggest disservice to the series is that we don’t get a scene either before or after the book 3 finale where Zuko returns to the village. I would be interesting to see him interact with the people there now changed and in a more diplomatic way
"Review: I think you're really underestimating exactly how traumatic a 100 year war would be for a nation.

The past four generations of my family were born within the last 100 years. If I was an Earth Kingdom villager, that would mean my great-grandfather, my grandfather, my father and me would have spent all (or a significant chunk) of their lives fighting against the Fire Nation. The people of the Earth Kingdom have literally spent generations losing family members to the war, or hearing about nearby villages getting burned down, or fleeing their own burning villages.

The Fire Nation is like the Nazis, but almost worse. At least the Nazis didn't manage to complete the Holocaust. The Fire Nation eliminated the Air Nomads - every man, woman and child burned alive until all there was left for Aang to find was bones. They reduced the Southern Water Tribe to a single village existing at sustenance levels. The Earth Kingdom knows it is fighting a war against an enemy that is not above resorting to genocide to win - imagine how much fear and hatred that would evoke.

Expecting the Villagers to not throw Zuko out is expecting them to be more emotionally intelligent and balanced than 99% of the humanity. Because Zuko isn't just a random Fire Nation dude - his is the son of the Fire Lord, and a fire-bender. Maybe if he was a non-bender he could have stayed, but in Avatar benders practically represent their nation. The people of the world aren't just scared of the Fire Nation - they're scared of fire-benders, and fire-bending itself. Firebending is basically black magic to them - its that scary thing Fire Nation soldiers will use to burn you alive if you cross them.

It wasn't just that Zuko was basically Hitler's son in a small Polish village during WW2, its worse. While he did save those people, but think of it like this; 

You are a Japanase villager, a year after Hiroshima and Nagasaki got erased by atom bombs. You have spent the past year watching the survivors of those disasters die from radiation poisoning, a lethal force you barely understand - its basically evil magic to you. Maybe you even have relatives that lived in Hiroshima and either died in the blast or succumbed to the radiation. Some gangsters try to mug you, but you get saved by a superhero. A superhero whose power is the ability to project rays of radiation at his enemies.

Are you letting that man stay the night? Of course not!"
"Review: You know before they banished him Zuko just beet up their entire garrison, leaving them vulnerable to a foreign attack right? Zuko did everything an enemy soldier would do."
"Review: I think this just clearly shows that fear and ignorance are irrational and it takes real strength of character to overcome them, strength that Zuko was building towards. The villagers were being human, and served as an important lesson on top."
"Review: It’s good and realistic writing, but is hurting because we love Zuko. People are suffering because of his nation, many may have lost family because of his nation, his family runs the whole thing. People are cruel and forget thing IRL. Imagine a chinese town in WW2. Imagine the women who heard of the rape of Nanjing and the massacres, the children who lost fathers. Imagine the son of Hiroito goes there and saves them from an abusive group of soldiers “protecting” it, and then reveals himself. These people would kill him or capture him, send him in chains to the capital. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE IN AN EMOTIONAL-SOCIOPOLITICAL CONFLICT."
"Review: They don't deserve any crap to happen to them though, seriously they aren't bastards for hating the son of the F\*cking fire lord."
Review: All and all this was a perfect episode imo
Review: I mean Zuko literaly has the entire fire nation on his tail. Even Azula who can alone destroy that viliage. Plus to them he is Ozai's son and part of the blood line that started the war. They had every rigth to banish him. Plus he rekted all of their defences as corrupt as they were.
Review: I have to disagree. I wish fans would stop coddling Zuko - and their favorite characters in general.
Review: Son of Hitler : Excuse me I'm born.
"Review: >Not horrible things

I wouldn't exactly describe standing up to the awful soldiers that gave an entire town trouble and used their authority to get away with it, in order to save an innocent life, as simple as that. I even said their reaction was explainable.

If Zuko gained a dislike towards the village after that incident, I wouldn't exactly blame him, to be honest. It's not like he himself was directly or even indirectly responsible for the deaths/forced recruitment of their families or even stop the ongoing death in his current state. Hence why I said the village giving banishment mere seconds after the reveal was not justified. Explainable, but not justified."
"Review: yeah, pretty much this

I feel like they were projecting all of the hatred they felt about the Fire Nation onto him, like they used him as a representative of the Fire Nation

(and like considering he's the crown prince, I can't entirely blame them for reacting the way they did? like *we* know that he meant well, but meaning well isn't going to wipe away the shit that the Fire Nation did to them)"
"Review: > perhaps most horrendously oppressed of the nations

Eh, I said that historically, the Airbenders win that. But present time, its the Southern Water Tribe, which are in pretty much a slow motion colonial genocide (they really wouldn't survive some decades more and needed mass inmigration from the Northern Water Tribe to rebuild). Not to downplay the suffering of the Earth Kingdom, especially as Ozai planned to celebrate his newfound power by commiting widespread massacres, but eh."
"Review: Zuko most definitely needed to learn that lesson that the Fire Nation ain't so well liked. If this episode's current events never happened, Zuko's redemption arc wouldn't be as popular and celebrated as it deservingly is!

I'm not even calling that part of the episode the worst writing in Avatar (IMO if you don't count the comics, that title goes to the random appearance of the Lion Turtle with little to no hints about energy bending within the show before the finale) or even garbage-tier writing. I'm just sharing that I'd be less disliking of the villagers as people if one of them, or rather one of the family Zuko assisted, was shown asking why he helped, or had more expressions to show that didn't appear like hatred or fear, or hesitation after being helped by the Fire Nation Prince."
Review: Hitler wishes he was voiced by Mark Hamill
"Review: And how is hitlers son responsible for anything Hitler did?

That's pretty fuckep up."
"Review: I’d be less heated about this episode’s ending if they alluded more to this for Zuko getting kicked. Zuko being Fire Nation doesn’t wholly determine his actions and doesn’t physically negatively affect the village automatically, as his showdown with those bad soldiers to rescue Lee proved. But his banishment (something one of the villagers even brought up) by Ozai? The fact that there’s a bounty on his head wanted by the Fire princess that would actually lead to more soldiers and psychos coming in to their place to claim this bounty and possibly cause some damage while they’re at it? Yeah, it’s more justifiable on why they don't want Zuko to stay there and get him out quick."
"Review: >I am more surprised that nobody decided to kill Zuko on the spot. I think the entire villain would have even teamed up with the earthbending soldiers to fight against him.

That would've been the stupidest thing to do as Zuko easely beat the earthbender soilders as soon as he started using firebending. I doubt they would be so stupid to piss of the son of the most powerful fire bender ever."
"Review: As I said in the post, I didn't expect the village to brush off Fire Nation atrocities so simply. But what would've been good to see was some sort of confusion or processing of what just happened would've been nice. Especially from the family since they had more of a reason to be confused. Though given that they were so swift to throw him out, I don't think Zuko saying he was some firebender wandering around rather than the Fire Lord's son would've made that reaction any different like I've heard some people say.

If I were some Jewish kid in WW2 living in some town essentially run by corrupt soldiers using their position and authority to abuse the hell out of everyone day by day, a guy FINALLY puts these assholes in their place and that guy is revealed as German or even Hitler's son, there WOULD be negative emotion to feel. But I'd be more confused that the evil guy's son bothered to help out.

I wouldn't be surprised if those corrupt Earthbender soldiers told their superiors that they TOTALLY chased off that dastardly Fire Nation prince to keep their positions and bully the villagers some more without any of said villagers so much as denying that lie."
"Review: Nah, I wouldn’t say it’s a bad choice, honestly it wouldn’t be realistic for Zuko to return to basically some random village he likely only found because he was lost"
"Review: I'm deadass surprised they weren't shown again in a comic by now, especially considering how popular and loved the episode itself is."
"Review: I mean, yes, but that clearly isn't why they are upset nor is this perspective expressed by any character."
Review: Right? That is a fucked up perspective. Sins of the father shouldn't fall on their sons.
"Review: So the local Earth Kingdom soldiers wouldn’t even be there if not for the war. The episode (and show as a whole) definitely touches on the theme that the horrors of war extend far beyond the battlefield.

From the perspective of the villagers, the soldiers are bad, but they’re only there because of the war, and the war is without a doubt the fault of the fire nation. Zuko is a prince of the fire nation, so he is without a doubt at least indirectly responsible for the war and therefore indirectly responsible for the degradations of the EK soldiers. Whether or not Zuko took personal action to cause the war is irrelevant to the villagers, because Zuko is a prominent member of the political class of the fire nation. Short of martyring himself for the cause of peace, he bears responsibility. In the first season of the show, he’s even mostly on board with the overall goals of the fire nation under his father. 

Now, as the audience, we know that Zuko is more complex than that. That’s why we like his arc so much. 

But the Earth Kingdom villagers do not have that perspective; to the Earth Kingdom villagers, Zuko is at best a fool trying to fight ruffians that he’s responsible for, and at worst the son of a genocidal tyrant who’s probably there on a secret mission to rape their town."
"Review: The fact that the village instatly sided with the soldiers means that they have more hatred to the Fire Nation then they had with the soldiers.

Maybe if Zuko was just a common Fire Nation guy, there would more willing to give him a chance, but Zuko is the very prince of it, his blood line is responsable for the village's suffering.

Yes, the soldiers are assholes, but at the end, they are just abusing their position, the Fire Nation in the other hand, is the reason why their people are dying in war."
"Review: Its different between each nation.

The Air Nomans all got exterminated, the Southern Water Tribe was cruely raided for years. The Earth Kindom was constantly singehandledly fighting off the Fire Nation, they were literally the only one stopping the Fire Nation from taking over the world."
"Review: This is iffy. They got massacred, but they were never enslaved to my knowledge. There is sort of a mercy there. But, the novels may add to that in ways I am unaware of. Being frank, *all* nations have a good reason to wanna kill any fire bender on sight."
"Review: This is what oppression means:

>prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control.

Prolonged. It doesn't apply to the airbenders, though what happened was horrible, they weren't the worst ""oppressed."""
"Review: Nothing to add, it's just that I don't see how any of this debating who the most oppressed is, matters to his point at all."
"Review: > of them, or rather one of the family Zuko assisted, was shown asking why he helped, or had more expressions to show that didn't appear like hatred or fear, or hesitation after being helped by the Fire Nation Prince.

Part of me thinks that had Lee's dad stayed, he may have been supportive of Zuko."
"Review: > But what would've been good to see was some sort of confusion or processing of what just happened would've been nice

I honestly feel the lack of confusion on the part of the villagers was the correct choice, because why *would* they be confused? Why would they care? Their sons and brothers were fighting the Fire Nation, their fathers fought the Fire Nation, and their *grandfathers* fought the Fire Nation. In their entire lives these people have never known peace, neither the youngest nor the oldest. Whatever news they *do* get of the war will always be bad, and we know this because it’s stated in the very first episode that the Fire Nation is near victory. People have turned on their own *neighbors* for far less, and what is Zuko besides a man who helped them *because* they helped *him*? That nobody harmed him as he left *is* the nuance, since they could have at least captured him and tried giving him to the Earth King as ransom against his father."
Review: exactly
"Review: Well, it shouldn't, but they still do"
"Review: You are absolutely correct that the soldiers would not be there if it weren't for the war, which contributes to their explainable reason to not like the Fire Nation. You are also correct that the village doesn't have the perspective that we, the audience have. This episode would've made LESS sense if Zuko was 100% accepted after the reveal of him being a prince of the Fire Nation. Though I can understand why they wouldn't want Zuko there, I can still dislike that not even Lee or his parents showed much hesitation in hating him or confusion in his actions. If at least one of them shown hesitation in processing what just happened for a couple seconds or so before letting their hatred and fear come in and act the same way they did when Zuko just got done, I wouldn't be writing this. If they did actually hesitate/process this or show any confusion, then the episode didn't exactly make that known.

But I personally disagree on Zuko being indirectly responsible for the war. The war was started by Sozin and both Azulon and Ozai decided to keep that war going despite being in positions of power to call off the troops and put an end to all the suffering. The fact that this Fire Nation prince is alone out here in the wilderness and even one of the villagers yelling out that the Fire Lord abandoned and scorned him shows that he is not in a position to affect this war. Especially not since he's a wanted figure. Princess Azula already put a bounty on his head before this episode's events."
"Review: Eh, I said ""erased from existance"" is more opressive that enslavement."
"Review: Back in the meeting that got him into the Agni Kai has Zuko only being upset at the idea of using Fire Nation soldiers as cannon fodder, he was not upset at the war itself.

He being exiled only indicate that Zuko is not only trash to the Earth Kindgom's perspective, but also trash to his own people. Zuko is worse than trash

In factThat elder from the village actually realized that Zuko was exiled for a reason.

Also, if Zuko is wanted by the Fire Nation, that only indicate that is just a matter of time before the Fire Nation reach the village looking for him. Which mean that whatever if Zuko is good or not, he is not worth the effort.

The point of the episode is that Zuko has absolutely nothing to be proud about himself."
Review: You kind of have to be alive to be oppressed.
"Review: Imma argue against that. IMO, as a black dood, Id rather die than have my rights and the rights of literally everyone I know and care about including my potential future family taken away while also being forced to work for our oppressors for the rest of our lives."
Review: The point is still there tho right? I haven’t watched Avatar in years but weren’t the air benders killed off just because of like a prophecy that the fire nation were scared of
"Review: I don't think your extermination would be quick tho, genocides historically involve the enslavement of the targets before because killing that many people in a single swoop is harder that it sounds."
"Review: Not really. Yes, the Airbenders were worse off than the Earth Kingdom, but they weren't ""more oppressed."""
"Review: Okay, but we're talking about ATLA, in which it happened in a single event."
Review: really liked to see how long zuko could hold out on using his fire ending while fighting. and of course the reveal just sucks bc no matter what he did for that family in the past day it can never make up for the sins of the fire nation.
"Review: One of the things this episode highlights is Zuko's innate goodness. Just little subtle things here and there. Like not stealing food from that couple once he realizes the woman is pregnant, prioritizing food for the ostrich horse over a meal for himself, not selling out the kids even after the Earth Kingdom soldiers confront him/steal his feed. Working for his next meal (when he easily probably could have stolen it if he really wanted). You get the idea. Although Zukos done messed up things like stealing this episode shows that he does have good moral instincts that would lead him to the path of good if he tried. 

""I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me strong. It's made me who I am."" - Quote from the end of Book 1 but applies to Zuko's journey in general."
"Review: First timer here.

* I love episodes about Zuko because they lead to so much character development and world-building.
* Zuko seems like someone who is a result of his upbringing. How different would he have been if he was born in a different tribe? On the contrary, I doubt there being any effect on Azula's nature.
* So many new hybrid animals shown in this episode, [Turtle ducks are adorable!](https://i.imgur.com/HhEz4Ud.png)
* The kids laughing at the thought of burning the city down reveals just how much the atrocities of war have been normalized in the royal family. It's clear that the fire nation is a land where psychopaths thrive, and Zuko and Iroh weren't cut out for it.
* Not only did Iroh lose his son, but he also lost his father and the throne as well. Watching the man who betrayed you take your rightful place, watching as all of your honor is stripped from you and still having to answer to him, this man has the patience of a saint. No wonder he is so indifferent towards the Avatar and the future of the Fire Nation.
* Azulon dies even though he was in perfect health, Zuko's mother disappears unexpectedly, all signs point to a familicide. Did Zuko never try to search for his mother? Or did he try and eventually give up?
* [Zuko's reveal was badass!](https://i.imgur.com/Kp37OuJ.png) Even when he discloses his identity, he says his mother's name first and then the Fire Lord's.
* It may seem harsh but I don't blame the villagers from despising Zuko. One kind act does undo all the horrors of war inflicted by his family."
Review: also I found the “made in Earth Kingdom” joke way funnier than I probably should have..
"Review: Such a small scene of an absolutely amazing episode, but I found it super compelling when you see Zuko and Azula playing and having fun together in that flashback where Ursa gets news about Lu Ten. I had never noticed before on previous watches. It just makes it all the more tragic seeing how this toxic family environment ruined a potentially loving sibling relationship."
"Review: I don't think I ever properly noticed that the kid in this episode is named Lee. Considering ""Lee"" is usually the name Zuko uses when he's trying to hide his identity, I wonder if the reason he kinda stumbled here when asked for his name was because he thought it'd be weird to say his name was also Lee lol.

I know we're told later that ""There's a million Lees"" and all, but still, Zuko was probably just too awkward to risk it. Big mood honestly."
"Review: At least in the top 5, maybe top 3 best episodes"
"Review: Great episode. I loved pretty much every part of it, but one that stood out to me was his putting his sword away after seeing the woman was pregnant. And him teaching the kids to use the swords. Oh and all of the flashbacks. And also him letting loose on the soldier with fire. The whole thing was great."
"Review: In my opinion, this is easily the best episode out of the entire series.  It felt like an old fashioned and badass spaghetti western while still having incredible character development that portrayed Zuko as the shows most nuanced character.  Also, the final battle and that shot where Zuko is surrounded by flames whilst holding two swords and kicking the shit out of the thugs is pure gold.  Fucking classic."
"Review: ""Oh and last night, Grandpa passed away."""
"Review: This first thing I wanted to point out is that this episode is the first one that does not show Team Avatar at all. We've gotten to see parts of Zuko's perspective throughout the show so far, but this is the first episode completely dedicated to his story, and because of that, it feels like a sort of turning point, making Zuko into one of the main characters from here on out.

It was so devastating to see that he was trying to be good and save Lee from the Earthbending ""soldiers"" yet as soon as Lee and his mom find out he's a firebender, they want nothing to do with him, even if he was protecting the kid. I believe this was the first time Zuko truly sees the evil of the fire nation-- he realizes that others hate firebenders and he hears the first hand account of what his father's regime is doing to innocent people like Lee's brother and the other Earth Kingdom captured soldiers. 

This is honestly the saddest episode so far for me. We see Zuko trying to be good, and for the first time, it seems he is not worried about catching the Avatar, yet he ends up hated and shunned again, similar to when he was banished by his own father. This episode also hurts more than any of the previous ones because we have no comic relief that we would normally get from Sokka and the others. The writers are making us truly empathize with Zuko's past, present, and his possible journey to goodness from now on."
"Review: Important theme for Zuko in this episode is acceptance, when he wanders into the village he has to keep his true self hidden or face being turned away, or worse. He’s welcomed in by the farmer and family, but then thinks back to the only time he was accepted with his mother, flaws and all. It’s shown very clearly what Ozai thinks of him, which influences how Azula acts towards him as well, Azulon doesn’t seem to be too interested in Zuko. 

Zuko has to hide who he really is because of where he is, and it probably shames him that he can’t be himself, he just wants to be accepted for who he really is, like with his mother. What makes his journey worse is when he is finally himself, and saves the village, he’s turned into a pariah, making it even worse for him since he’s not only accepted who he is but has been rejected because of it again. 

Also, something I should put out in regards to Iroh, a lot of people forget that even though he did break through the Outer Wall and made light of burning Ba Sing Se to the ground, >!it’s still after he has encountered Masters (Ran and Shaw), so they seen him as worthy before this, it just took Lu Ten’s death to make him change his perspective completely.!<"
"Review: Man this one is such a mood whiplash from the previous one.  The Gaang has a hilarity-filled adventure watching Toph kick everyone's ass, meanwhile Zuko is going through this."
Review: Is this the only episode where people use bending with weapons? (the soldier earthbending with his hammers and Zuko firebending with his blades.) It's just really cool to me. Oh and Aang's staff doesn't really count.
"Review: So many things I love about this episode, but here's a few:

It is framed as something of a hero moment, but Zuko declaring his parenthood is actually him regressing, falling back on old coping techniques. He's embracing his old pride as Ozai's son, after he was finally starting to let go of it with the Earth nation family. BUT using Ursa's name before Ozai's shows a crack in that pride, a desire to be more than just the heir to Ozai's throne.

Learning that Ozai was the second son also adds another dimension to the Agni Kai and Zuko's rivalry with Azula. It's never explicitly stated, but both Ozai and Azulon seem to want Azula to inherit instead of Zuko. There were other ways for Azulon to punish Ozai: having him kill Zuko was both poetic and convenient. And Ozai's quickness to publicly humiliate and disown Zuko makes more sense if he wants to legitimize Azula's claim.

I also like that, while Ursa is sympathetic, her failings as a parent are definitely visible. She isn't idealized in the flashbacks. She is introduced telling Zuko that she's like the turtleduck mom, that she'll bite back if someone threatens him--that she'll protect him. In the very next scene, Azula easily manipulates her into pushing Zuko to play with her, all so she can screw with him and her, ""friend,"" Mai. Why Ursa left is never explicitly stated (she may have died), but she clearly made a choice, and the fact remains that she left Zuko behind with his father and sister. The rest is history branded on his face.

And I like that Earth nation soldiers are the asshole bullies of this episode, and Zuko is the underdog. I love it when the show refuses to confine, ""evil,"" to one of the four nations, and they do some of the best work in Book 2 showing the diversity, for good and for bad, of the Earth nation."
Review: I love how the nails Zuko used are all bent and all over the place. It really shows that he didn't do any gard work before.
"Review: I love this episode. The Zuko stuff is great of course, as everyone else has already pointed out, but I also personally find the backstory and lore of the Fire Nation royal family to be *so* fascinating and intriguing. I could easily watch an entire show just based around the politicking and scheming that went down in the Royal Household over the past few generations, and there's still so much about these characters that could be expanded upon.

If I did have one minor complaint, it would be that I wish they had nudged Azula's character over just a tiny bit during the flashback portions. I'm not saying she should be a sweet little girl who's best friends with Zuko or anything like that, but I do think she didn't have to be *as* overtly cruel and heartless as she was shown to be here. I'm realize that some children are just sociopathic by nature, and that Ozai would absolutely encourage that kind of behavior in his favorite child, but I've always felt like they could at least have shown us a few flashes of childhood innocence when she was this young, just to help the audience appreciate the fact that she was *molded* into becoming the villain we know her as, rather than just being like that naturally.

Heck, some of the lines she has this episode don't just seem cartoonishly evil, they also seem... just kinda ill-advised, I guess? Like, even if you're already cold and nefarious enough at that age to want your Firelord grandpa to die and be replaced on the throne, isn't still pretty stupid to talk about it so openly in his own palace? Considering Ozai was trying to charm his way onto the throne at first, you'd think he'd have told Azula to tone down the ""Grandpa's old and useless and probably gonna die soon"" talk lol"
"Review: First time watcher here. I had heard this episode was really acclaimed, but didn't know much else going on.

* Wow that was a fantastic piece of character writing. Zuko backstory is so god damn tragic. 

* I just loved the western look of this episode. The directing was great. The shots of Zuko riding through that large field. Just great.

* Zuko popping off at the end was amazing and terrifying. I know he is not a prodigy like Azula, but i feel like he has this hidden potential. Heartbreaking that even though he saved that kid, everyone shunned him because of who he is."
"Review: [Zuko Alone](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/lb_i.php?lb_id=13083663820B12460100&i_id=13110471760I56460200&p=28) - one of the better episodes in Book 2, and if there was one thing I wished I could know about more of, it's the lives of the ordinary people living in these tough times. The stuff that asshole mentioned about sending untrained soldiers to be killed painted a super grim picture of how fucked up and desperate most of the Earth Kingdom really is.

Also, let it be known that whenever someone brings up the idea of the Avatar World being Eastern influenced only, they can take good long look at the fact that this episode is basically a western movie that follows as many western story beats as possible regardless of the the outcome. 

Oh, and this episode & TLOK's ""Korra Alone"" are 2 of the best episodes in the series."
"Review: Man, this episode hits different as an adult. I found myself almost crying when Zuko's mom left, lol. I remember when I watched this as a kid, I felt bad for Zuko at the end when the villagers rejected him. Watching this as an adult, I'm 100% on the villagers side. Fantastic episode."
"Review: Great episode. 

That being said it's a bit wierd that this random earth kingdom villager knows that Zuko was banished and burned his father. Zuko's own crew in season one had no idea and they are actually from the fire nation , and it's not as if any other random earth kingdom people seem to know either."
"Review: This was the episode where Zuko became my favorite character. 

One of the best in the series for sure. ""captainmidnight"" on YouTube has a great video on this episode called ""The Beauty of Zuko Alone."" 

If you haven't watched it, definitely check it out."
"Review: This is the first episode where I truly became conflicted in my feelings about Zuko. It was clear from previous episodes that he had a rough past, but this episode humanized him while giving a fantastic ode to western cinema, all in 20 minutes. Fantastically written and executed. Rivals ""Tales from Ba Sing Se"" and ""Appas Lost Days"" in its impact."
Review: This is easily one of the most important episodes in the show. The flashback is so well done.
Review: This is one of the best episodes in the entire series. Really sheds light on the experiences that made Zuko who he is.
Review: I recently watched Yojimbo and the similarities to the last scene are very striking. Pretty strong Kurosawa influences in this episode.
"Review: I started crying one minute into the episode and didn’t stop until after it was over. I think this is probably the best written episode in the series and wish they’d done something like this for the other characters. Everything is so perfect, from the flashbacks to the worldbuilding and characterization-especially regarding the duality of Zuko."
"Review: I love how the theme of Zuko having to fight and work hard to succeed is highlighted in this episode and reinforced through the memories of his mother. We see it most strongly in the memory of the fire bending performance in front of the fire lord. 

What I wonder is, what is the eventual pay off of this? (Warning: this conversation is strictly for those who have seen future episodes. Spoiler tags please!)

Clearly Zuko is not as strong of a bender as Azula. >!The fact that things don’t come easily for him allows him to slow down and think for himself (eventually) on what he is looking for and needs from life. But does this eventually translate to fire bending abilities?!<"
"Review: This is my first rewatch since I was a kid (I’m now 22) so while everything is familiar, it’s often like I’m watching it for the first time and then I’m hit with memories and nostalgia. I think this used to be one of my favorite episodes and the one that made me fully invested in Zuko and his character arc.

By the end he was my favorite character so I’m excited to relive where his story goes."
"Review: My thoughts on this episode:

\- This episode is like a new beginning for Zuko, who is beginning to see on his own how the fire nation uprooted innocent families and how sometimes not everyone is good or evil. The rogue Earth Kingdom soldiers are an amazing touch to this, as they show that not all battles are pure black and pure white. Even within the good, there is bad, and even in the bad, there is good. Just like Yin and Yang.

\- Learning about Zuko's childhood opens the audience's eyes to how much he loved his mother, how much she loved him, >!and also provides insight into Azula's manipulative and sadistic nature.!< 

\- The scene where Zuko defends Lee from the Earth Kingdom soldiers is amazing, both as an action sequence and as an important plot point. Not only does it reinforce the concept of Yin and Yang, it shows how people are quick to judge and will hate based on name and originality only."
Review: Possibly my second-favorite one-off episode (not counting finales / multi-parters) and certainly the best one we've seen yet. *A Fistful of Honor* is a great homage to a movie genre you wouldn't necessarily expect here. (Though as someone pointed out it also might be referencing Kurisawa's work; not just spaghetti westerns that are in part based on his films.)
"Review: Loved this episode to bits. Most of what I love has been mentioned already, but just wanted to add: the symbolism of the swords was really cool. Zuko says they shouldn't be thought of as separate; they're 2 parts of the same whole. Could be referring to how Zuko is part of the Fire Nation but strives for goodness, so that conflict, that push and pull, is all felt within the same character. 

Felt like this extended to Zuko in terms of the overall story too. Zuko's journey compliments Aang's, and the two share the same destiny, different as they may be. They're two parts of the same whole, and ATLA is almost as much Zuko's story as it is that of Aang and the gaang."
Review: I really hate how the family treats Zuko after they find out he is from the fire nation. He just saved the kid! Just ignoring him would suffice rather being downright rude
"Review: This episode was reminiscent of Western movies! Stranger walks in to town, fights against town bully, emerges victorious, and leaves for parts unknown. One of the best episodes hands down. They gave Zuko so much character here."
"Review: As I get older, I appreciate this episode a lot more. Love that they took the time to flesh out Zuko"
"Review: 10/10 

One of my all time favorite episodes."
"Review: I’ve been waiting for this one to come up, it’s one of my favorite episodes, and some people have it as their #1."
Review: Easily my favorite episode. I really empathized Zuko at the end when the kid denied his knife. That experience must have hit hard for Zuko and made him realize how much the fire nation has hurt these people. The hate was strong enough to turn a kid who previously compared him to his own brother who he lost to the war in a single day. I also love how Zuko is still proud of his name and heritage even tho he has been cast out and hunted by his own father and sister.
Review: The best Zuko episode and honestly one of the top 5 episodes of this series!!
"Review: Sort of a first timer here....watched as a kid when it aired on nick as well as reruns on nicktoons, but I didn’t really quite understand the themes and motifs as I wasn’t young enough to not remember but not old enough to really take it all in. I find myself watching episodes and saying “hey! I remember this!!! I know what happens!” (Such as Parts 1 and 2 of “Journey to Ba Sing Se” which I remember vividly, as certain episodes were replayed heavily.), And others scratching my head not remembering too vividly, such as this one.
Anyway, I thought I’d share my thoughts on this episode as it is one of my top 5 so far on my “rewatch” this comment of mine is on an app for like TV tracking/rating, check it out. 
I’m fairly new to reddit and don’t comment or post much, so I hope this works! Might try to post an image of my whole paragraph thing, I’m sorry im way too lazy to rewrite it and I can’t copy/paste the words, only allowed me to share the link

"Review: Zuko is definitely the strongest point of Avatar atm for me, I love his character and as soon as I saw that this was a solo episode for him, I knew it was going to be great

It was also great to know more about the Fire Nation"
Review: You could start the entire show by watching this episode before Season 1 Episode 1
Review: Who tf voted 1
Review: Just watched this
"Review: > what he did for that family in the past day

Plus I mean, did you see the shit job he did trying to hammer those nails into the barn roof? They probably ran him outta town for that alone...

(Actually though, I do think it's a great little touch of detail that Zuko is complete shit at manual labour, given his background lol)"
"Review: > Like not stealing food from that couple once he realizes the woman is pregnant

It’s a good thing, too, cause if he *had* taken their food then I imagine their situation would have been quite... **Hope**less

Ah? Ah? I'm here all week folks."
"Review: Exactly! I love that when confronted by the thugs, he *always* places himself between Lee/his family and the danger at hand. He constantly risks his wellbeing to protect others. 

Also, remember when Zuko said he didn't need luck, and he didn't want it either? He had to struggle and fight for everything, and he doesn't feel comfortable/know how to cope with receiving things that are unearned. Whether that be hospitality in this episode (he declines food but agrees to be fed only when Lee's family suggests he can help out/work for this meal) or in later episodes, >!when he can't understand why Iroh would forgive him freely. !< To me, that's really important - it shows that he's not used to receiving anything unconditionally, even love or affection. 

This episode made my heart ache for Zuko. But it also showed me that even though he's not the avatar, ATLA is almost as much his story as it is the story of Aang and the gaang. Without Zuko's struggle and self-discovery, ATLA would not have been what it was."
Review: I always thought the implication was the second bag of feed was for Zuko himself. Since he was desperate and malnourished
"Review: I love the your analysis! I didn't realize that Zuko says Ursa's name first! Zuko's relationship with her/her disappearing was one of the most painful things this episodes. Makes you wonder to your second point how Zuko would have been if she was still there. 

In regards to Iroh, part of me wonders if Iroh felt relief for not having to take over the throne. Just food for thought there."
"Review: > The kids laughing at the thought of burning the city down reveals just how much the atrocities of war have been normalized in the royal family. 

Not just the family either. Ursa herself isn't born into royalty, and is clearly shown to be the most gentle, kind member of the family unit, and yet even she seems perfectly charmed by the notion of Iroh burning an entire city to the ground. The Fire Nation has made a very concentrated effort to engrain its beliefs in the general population over the past several generations.

> Azulon dies even though he was in perfect health, Zuko's mother disappears unexpectedly, all signs point to a familicide.

Pfft, look at Mr. Conspiracy Nut over here! Come on man, obviously Azulon just had a sudden change of heart, decided to make Ozai his heir instead of Iroh, and then he was so happy with his decision that he felt it was his time to pass away of old age. And Fire Lady Ursa is uh... just on vacation, grieving for her father-in-law. She'll be back any day now."
"Review: After Iroh’s son, Lu Ten died, he lost appetite for war and for the Fire Nation’s conquest. It was the event that made Iroh go on his spiritual journey and to focus on that rather than helping the Fire Nation. Although he must have been saddened to hear of his father, it’s never been said he felt he hated Ozai for claiming the throne, Iroh would only have to blame himself if he did still care since Ozai took the throne because Iroh didn’t return after Ba Sing Se. 

As for Zuko and his mother, you’ll have to wait and find out."
"Review: One of the main things with Zuko is his duality. Just watch the scene where he teaches Lee about the dual swords (the shot where Zuko’s swords divide in face in half is *chef’s kiss* in particular). Like the swords, Zuko is really two halves of the same whole: his capacity for good (represented by Ursa, Iroh, and >!Roku!<) and his capacity for bad (shown through Ozai, Azula, and >!Sozin!<). The halves are constantly at war with each other, as visually represented by his face. For Zuko to be truly happy, he has to reconcile these two halves and accept both live inside him."
"Review: Was looking forward to this episode for you for a while, knowing how much you're invested in Zuko as a character. It's amazing how well they do it, and the fact that ""Zuko Alone"" refers to both hi being alone in the Earth Kingdom (without Iroh) as well as being alone in the Episode (no Aang, soka, Katara taking up any facetime). They give his story his own episode, showing you a ton of back story and just how important they feel he is to the show overall. Great Catch on ""Son of Ursa and Firelord"" Also great seeing Zuko leave the same way he came: Down, hurt, alone, and not really all that better off (except for greater knowledge of what ppl think of him and the Fire Nation)"
"Review: Is it ever explained why Iroh doesn't get the throne? They explain what happened to his son and that happened shortly before Azulon's death, but what we see of Azulon clearly indicates Iroh is to be the next Fire Lord. Is the reason Ozai gets the throne instead tied into the mystery of what happened to Ursa? Clearly Iroh is not disgraced in anyway as he still takes part in war meetings and is by all indications still a high ranking player in Fire Nation politics and military strategy, as seen in the earlier episode where he explains to the crew of the ship how Zuko got his scar.

I feel like these were points that were meant to be revealed in the show - I see no reason why the showmakers would want this to be a big question mark. So why wasn't it addressed?"
"Review: Thank you for the analysis!

As a side note, once you're done watching the series (and I strongly recommend watching the WHOLE series without skipping any episodes), read the comics that begin immediately after Book 3, Episode 21 (The Promise, The Search, The Rift, Smoke and Shadow, North and South, and Imbalance, in that order. You can search them up online). >!Many of those comics really help build Zuko's storyline and past beyond what's shown on screen, especially ""The Search"".!< There's also a prequel to Zuko's story that begins immediately after >!the Agni Kai between Zuko and his dad.!<"
"Review: I don’t feel the villagers genuinely hate him, but rather feel conflicted. They could’ve easily lynched him had they so desired, especially in the beat, malnourished state he was in. Their parting was amicable and peaceful, even through harsh words. Zuko’s presence lays open painful wounds, even though they’re aware Zuko bears them no ill will, and had been harmed by the Fire Nation himself. Though a few good deeds won’t undo the century or war and suffering, the peaceful parting shows unspoken gratitude and understanding. 

For the disgraced prince of the nation that had caused untold suffering to the villagers, being able to leave town without bloodshed nor violence is really a fantastic outcome."
Review: [removed]
"Review: It's basically ""Made in China"""
"Review: Ozai dragged Azula off the path of being a good sister, but I do have to give her and Ty Lee props for shipping Mai and Zuko so early on lol. Doing her brother at least one solid."
Review: In that scene you also see Azula reacts with sadness to Lu Ten’s death as well. I think loving Lu Ten was one thing that the two had in common and could bond over.
"Review: They were haiving fun, but Azula can fun with Zuko so long as she has the upper hand."
Review: That’s definitely what I thought when he hesitated to give his name!
"Review: Ironically it’s the only ATLA episode that didn’t have Aang, Sokka and Katara present."
Review: It’s insane how much character building the do in this one episode
Review: Easy top three if you count finales as a singular story. But even without doing that I think it still makes it
Review: Are you a first time watcher? Regardless the couple they show in this episode appear in a few more episodes this season. Highlights civilians/refugees life in the background.
"Review: Ursa: That's what mothers are like, Zuko. If you mess with their babies, they're going to bite you back!

Azulon: Iroh has suffered enough, but *your* punishment has scarcely begun! You must know the pain of losing a firstborn son by sacrificing your own!

[Ursa:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI)"
"Review: Sheesh, you can clearly tell that she was born a psychopath."
"Review: > Azulon doesn’t seem to be too interested in Zuko.

Honestly though, Azulon doesn't seem that interested in *either* of them. Granted we only ever see the one interaction, but in that particular audience at least it's clear that Azulon immediately catches on to the fact that Ozai is just using the kids to try and impress and butter him up.

What I find very interesting there is the *way* in which Ozai tries to do that. He has his kids prattle off their knowledge about military history and strategy, and has them demonstrate their firebending. Despite the fact that he wants Azulon to make him heir, he makes no attempt to paint himself or his kids as being particularly smart or gifted in governance, he just focuses on the military side of things.

What's fascinating to me is that, as far as we know at least, Ozai *hasn't* served in the military. We know for a fact that Sozin, Azulon, Iroh, and Lu Ten all personally served in the army, oversaw battles and participated in combat, and they were all respected for their service. We can pretty safely assume that military service is looked on as a duty and a display of honor within the Fire Nation, including the royal family. Ozai, however, seems to just be sitting around in the capital doing fuck all, despite being younger than Iroh and an amazingly powerful bender in his own right. Zuko and Azula also never *really* join the war effort, at least not directly in a front lines capacity. It makes me wonder whether part of why Azulon didn't think highly of Ozai or his kids was because, despite all of Ozai's militant blustering, he's actually kinda the disappointing nerd child (at least at this point in his life) who just talks a big game. 

That, in turn, would kind of make Ozai the Zuko of his own sibling dynamic, and might very well have played a part in Ozai's resentment of his own son as well, since he sees in Zuko all the parts of himself that he hates, while Azula has all the parts of himself that he wants to emphasize (which is why he makes a point of showing her off)."
"Review: One of the cool things about this show is that the, ""true self,"" concept is so nuanced. Zuko was arguably closer to his deepest self when he *wasn't* firebending or being the Blue Spirit. His connection to Lee is somehow pure, because it's disconnected from his position in the world, his status and where he was born. That makes it all the more tragic when those very things break that bond."
"Review: Huh, I think you're right. It's *talked* about elsewhere when >!Aang mentions his windsword idea!< but I think that's it aside from the staff."
"Review: Interesting that you say Zuko is regressing by connecting to his family. That moment occurs right after the flashback of his mother’s last words to him: “Remember who you are” (which when I write it, I’m hearing it in Mufasa’s voice lol). I also believe that line is used in earlier episode, maybe from Iroh. Does anyone remember?

If his mother is meant to be Zuko’s conscious, his pull towards doing good and having (the right kind of) honor, then her words and Zuko’s speech must mean something different than you’re interpretation as a regression. 

I’d argue that as the rightful heir of the Fire Throne, Zuko’s responsibility is to the people of the fire nation. And what’s best for them is to NOT conquer the world and continue on the current trajectory of the fire nation. It’s to do their part to maintain balance between the 4 nations. Zuko revealing his identity, showing these earth kingdom people that there are people in the fire nation who will stand up to injustice, ensure balance in the world, is step on a journey towards “remembering who he is”, the responsibilities he has, the errors he needs to mend. 

^I’m still developing that idea so any feedback or additions are highly appreciated! (But remember to spoiler tag if talking about future plot/character developments). What other interpretations do people have for the “remember who you are” moment?"
"Review: I disagree. I do not think Zuko acknowledging his family is a bad thing at all. The whole point of his arc IMO is that he must learn to accept who he is while also not letting that define him. He is not Lee, the tea merchant refugee from Ba Sing Se. He IS Zuko, heir to the throne and all that jazz yes but more importantly is that ""Zuko"" bit. He is who he is, he shouldn't try and escape from that but change it for the better."
Review: Azula didn't fail as a parent ozai and azulon is the reason azula is evil
"Review: There is still a brief scene, only two or three seconds, that shows Zuko and Azula having innocent fun in this episode"
"Review: I get your argument that seeing more of the, ""original,"" Azula could have been effective. And while I agree with you that Azula was clearly being groomed and molded by her father, I think it's just as effective to leave that unsaid. Zuko always felt frustrated that things that came hard for him seemed to come naturally for Azula, and arguably the deepest tragedy of children raised in situations like this is the way they mold themselves, taking their cues from the adults around them. Azula was, for better and ultimately for worse, better at that than Zuko was. 

Also, while for Zuko it feels like Azula was doing all this easily, between these scenes and her, ""one hair out of place,"" scene it seems very possible that Azula was really just making it *look* easy to please adults and tear down Zuko. She goes out of her way several times to show Zuko how much better and smarter she is than he is, which suggests that she is actually threatened by him maybe as much as he is by her. This is another dimension of the cycle of familial self-destruction in the Fire Lord palace."
"Review: I would have loved a scene like that in Azula's story, but I understand why it's not here because its from Zuko's POV. He probably didn't have purview to Ozai's influence over Azula."
"Review: I think though Azula is not necessarily molded into a villain. Sure, she's molded into the villain that she becomes, but it seems evident she's born with psychopathic tendencies and probably would've become *some kind of* villain no matter what, unless raised in a manner that was tailored to her [probable] mental illness."
"Review: Agree 100%. It definitely would’ve made more fans empathize with her character instead of condemning her to life in prison or death. 

Also we see Ozai punishing Zuko to the extreme. It would have been interesting to see the other side of the coin in which Ozai is manipulating Azula at a young age. The girl never stood a chance, yet that was never shown on screen."
"Review: He might not be a fire bending prodigy, be at least he's a prodigy with swords!"
"Review: There's no real right or wrong in that situation, except the bullies. The villagers rejected Zuko even after he helped them--but of course they did, he just declared he's the son of Ozai. Still, there's an argument to be made that they could have reacted better. No clean answer, I love the nuance!"
Review: Word probably spread because of Zuko being wanted by the Fire nation. So he became more well known through the earth kingdom.
"Review: Right, that line is a bit much. But hey Azula's out there and she probably loves telling the story to any open ear."
"Review: TBH, there is no competition when it comes to ""Appa's Lost Days""."
"Review: It's interesting; Kurosawa was strongly influenced by American Westerns while making Yojimbo, and Yojimbo became a strong influence on Italian (and other) Westerns, including this episode.

Kurosawa, of course, was always a giant of Japanese cinema, but he also was thought to be ""too Western"" and ""not Japanese enough"" in his film sensibilities by both some European critics and Japanese critics."
"Review:  “My father says Azula was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don’t need luck, though. I don’t want it. I’ve always had to struggle and fight and that’s made me strong. That’s made me who I am"""
Review: I mean. To them he basically represents the source of the war.
"Review: I mean, Zuko’s family did cause the war that took his brother away in the first place, plus the news of Omashu’s fall had probably just arrived so morale was likely low."
"Review: Besides representing everything bad about the war, he is also identified as an outcast of the Fire Nation.  From the townspeople's perspective, even the enemy has rejected Zuko.  And Zuko knows all of that is true."
"Review: The kid's a kid, so I understand his reaction. But the mother acting the way she did after *she* asked Zuko, a stranger, to help, was pretty unfair."
Review: Also since he’s starving he doesn’t really have muscle mass to swing a hammer with anyway...its kinda a wonder he was able to fight for as long as he did
"Review: Wait, is that actually the same couple that shows up in the Serpent’s Pass?"
Review: Sokka? Is that you?
"Review: Hmm... current Iroh does seem like someone who would enjoy leisure more than power. But we haven't really seen by much of him before retirement, and what he was like before the death of his son."
"Review: Hahaha, sure. And Ozai's punishment was the responsibilities of kingship, wasn't it?"
Review: I would highly advise you to read the comic sequels to the television series (specifically The Promise and The Search). >!You'll learn what REALLY happened to Firelord Azulon and Ursa.!<
"Review: Interesting. You're right, they did mention Iroh not returning immediately after his siege on Ba Sing Se.

So Iroh might think Ozai took the throne by necessity rather than desire. If so, it's unlikely Iroh even knows that Ozai tried to usurp him."
"Review: Yeah, while I doubt Iroh was necessarily *happy* about the fact that Ozai basically launched a palace coup and potentially killed their father, but at the same time I imagine he definitely didn't want to be Fire Lord by the time it happened. 

He might have reluctantly stepped up to take the throne if things had played out naturally, but he might also have just abdicated in his brother's favor anyway. We can't really know for sure because we never really got that much backstory on what the relationship was like between Iroh and Ozai as brothers when they were younger, though I *desperately* wish that we did."
"Review: During Azulon's funeral/ Ozai's coronation, a fire sage says:

>As was your\[Azulon\] dying wish, you are now succeeded by your second son. 

So by fire nation law they (the sages, nobility, military) recognize the right of the fire lord to choose their heir, even if its not their first born.  


We as the audience know what Azulon thought of passing the birthright to Ozai, but that was a private conversation. There simply isn't evidence that anyone outside the royal family would know Azulon greatly preferred Iroh, and even if a preference was known the idea that Azulon would change his mind because of the siege (and Iroh's subsequent disappearance) is believable enough.   


I think the clear implication, simply from this episode, is that Ozai was there around when Azulon died, and lied about what his father said so he could take the throne. The fire nation elite either believed Ozai's story or didn't want to argue about it (especially since the only other candidate was still missing). By the time Iroh does return its likely Ozai had been established as fire lord for some time, and he didn't have it inside of him to challenge his brother's rule.

>!The story of ursa's disappearance and Azulon's death are given more details in The Day of Black Sun and then fully explained in The Search comic. For whatever reason they didn't include it in the show, i think simply down to not being able to fit it in well during season 3B, and not just wanting Ursa to pop-up in the finale. At some point they planned to have the search for zuko's mom be an animated tv movie but that was rejected which is part of what lead to the comics. Frankly though I think the show was fine as is not exploring these elements further. !<"
"Review: Thanks, I'll be sure to look it up! And also come back to your comment and reveal the spoilers :)"
Review: [deleted]
Review: Lmao yeah you’re right. Who knew Azula would be a good wingman 😂😂
Review: Azula wasn't sad
Review: That's because Zuko is the best. I don't even think I would be watching this show if it weren't for Zuko.
"Review: Yeah, honestly the only book 3 finale episode that breaks top 3 for me is part 3, but I'm biased because Azula is literally my favorite character. The other ones are all top 10 for sure, but Siege of the North, Crossroads and a few others are all better for me."
"Review: Yeah this is my first time. That's good to know, I'll keep my eyes peeled for them."
"Review: ...Ohh, I couldn't connect the dots till I saw this comment."
Review: Basically you’re saying Ozai is a chicken-hawk and I totally agree lol
Review: Kyoshi (and Aang) used her fans to bend.
"Review: Hmm I don't think it's as clear cut as his mother representing doing good and have real honor. Ursa isn't a bad person by any means and she did her best, but she is complicit in this environment. Azula manipulated her fairly easily in the first scene where we saw them together, and she laughed as hard as the rest of them when Iroh joked about burning down Ba Sing Se. When she says, ""remember who you are,"" I think she does mean that she sees he has a kind heart--but she's also acknowledging that she can't help him protect it anymore. She doesn't say, ""remember me,"" it's about who Zuko is--and who he is is not his titles or position. That individual is, ""weak,"" to his father, and is often near being overwhelmed by the 'prince,' identity. This reflects Aang's journey, balancing being the Avatar with being Aang. When Zuko declares his full title and identity, it's the equivalent of Aang going into the Avatar State. It's an assertion of one powerful identity over the more fragile individual identity. It's all out of balance. 

I don't think he has an idea of making a political choice about what he wants to represent of his nation. It's a purely personal defense, a reaction to being threatened. He didn't *need* to do shout his parents' names.
>!Immediately after this, he goes right back to where he started, hunting down Aang. He hadn't done that since Zhao died in the first season, but there he is again.!< He's moving forward from a faraway perspective, and he is more in balance in this episode than any point except maybe when he thought Ozai wanted him back. But it's three steps forward, then one back."
"Review: I totally agree with you about Zuko's arc--I think where we differ is the meaning of this scene in that arc. He's not just acknowledging his family in this scene, he's trying to make that family status define him in order to protect his individual identity. So much so that, when he tries to re-make his genuine connection with the little Lee, he's unable to do so."
"Review: And that's good (though really that scene is more like 0.5 of a second than even 2 or 3 lol, they're literally just running around in the background) but I would have loved to have a bit more of that before she went full demon child."
"Review: The episode is Zuko's POV, that explains why we see nothing of that. But there is still a brief scene, only two or three seconds, that shows Zuko and Azula having innocent fun in this episode. It's nice to have this little moment of Azula just being an innocent child having normal kids' fun with her brother. She wasn't totally rotten."
Review: I could understand that spreading the news that he was considered an enemy of the fire nation and not recognized as Ozai's heir anymore. But I don't think the wanted posters would include the specific details of his father first banishing and burning him.
"Review: Yeah, that one cut me deepest"
"Review: I do think that maybe, had Zuko just used firebending but never identified himself as Ozai's son (and wasn't recognized by anyone in the village as such), they probably would've been like ""Well it's probably best that you leave town now, but thanks for the help at least""

But yeah, once he outs himself as the child of literally Hitler, it's not hard to understand why the village doesn't want anything to do with him. It's not necessarily fair of them, but you can still see where they're coming from."
"Review: >  But the mother acting the way she did after she asked Zuko, a stranger, to help, was pretty unfair.

I mean to be fair to her, it was kinda Zuko's fault in the first place, since he's the one who gave Lee the knife. Admittedly the mother says she doesn't know where he got it from, but I feel like she probably had at least a suspicion that it might have come from Zuko."
"Review: I know right! She said to Zuko ""Don't take another step"" as if he would hurt the kid just after he saved him!"
"Review: He's definitely visibly scrawnier than he used to be, but he's still strong enough to take out 3 of those soldiers with basically his bare hands, and to deflect actual boulders with his swords.

Honestly even if he was at full strength, the way he holds and swings the hammer is so visibly wrong lol, he's definitely got *no* idea what he's doing"
"Review: Yup. They show up here, the Serpent's Pass, *and* in Episode 1 of Book 3 as well.

I assume they're meant to act as a sort of window into the lives of average people (refugees, in this case) who're just trying to get by."
"Review: Exactly, Zuko ran away before he saw the rest of the conversation.

""YOUR PUNISHMENT HAS SCARCELY BEGUN... Nah I'm just messing with you kiddo, you've actually got a pretty good point. I'd be very happy to make you my heir, now if you'll excuse me I'm starting to feel a bit tired."""
"Review: I've read them, and I'm familiar with what really happened lol. I was engaging in what the youths like to call exaggerated sarcasm :P"
"Review: I don’t think I’ll end up reading the comics soon but I’ve heard what happened to Ursa, can you spoiler tag me on what happened to Azulon?"
"Review: I don’t know about that, Iroh is a smart man and understands his brother’s nature. I think he likely knows, but simply has no desire for the throne at that point, much less wants it enough to fight his brother for it. But that’s just speculation on my part"
"Review: Well he would have known about Azulons ""dying wish"" to put Ozai on the throne so you cant really make the argument that Iroh thought he did it out of necessity."
"Review: Is it true that people figured out what happened to Zuko's mother >!before The Search revealed it? Did people actually figure out that Ozai had Ursa create a poison to assassinate his own father in return for sparing Zuko's life and banishment from the palace? !<

>!If that was the case, the novel's existence isn't really to tell the viewer what happened; but rather to give Zuko the closure and motivation he desired as the Fire Lord when everything seemed uncertain after the war. If you think of The Search as less of ""time to tell you after 6 years lol"" and more of Aang trying to help Zuko come to terms with the past and to look to the future, it's actually pretty likable.!<"
"Review: You should fix your spoiler tags, it spoils it."
"Review: She definitely wasn’t trying to be, she was making fun of them the whole time. But it still worked lol"
"Review: Honestly, Book 1 Zuko was alright, I thought he was gonna be one of those incompetent, hot-headed sort of villain with some tragic past, but in Book 2 my opinion changed completely. Zuko is literally the gold-standard for character development in a TV show."
Review: [deleted]
Review: My 3 year old daughter always wants to pretend I’m prince Zuko and play “catch that avatar” when we go on walks.
Review: [removed]
"Review: I mean, it's reasonable to believe that the fans are bladed, right?"
"Review: Yea that’s fair. I think I got a little overboard with my analysis. 

So how does his mother’s “remember who you are” translate to his subsequent actions? Remember Zuko that you have to fight and work hard to get what you want. So what? That this fight won’t be easy and use your fire bending? I don’t see the connection"
"Review: Agree. Still, it's nice to have this little moment of Azula just being an innocent child having normal kids' fun with her brother. She wasn't totally rotten."
"Review: Yeah, I wanted to see more of that. Three seconds definitely isn’t enough. It’s a shame they only showed Azula being mean/evil in her youth. 

I would’ve loved an “Azula Alone” episode where they show her being more human."
"Review: I think it's more that, before being wanted, it was very hush hush that he even existed. Once wanted, the stories of his life become public and spread because ""did you hear about that? Did you know my cousins friend is a guard at the palace and..."" and eventually gets to the earth kingdom that way"
Review: That was a >!why am I so bad at being good!< moment for sure.
"Review: Well, I mean the fire nation was basically Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan at that point (wars of aggression, genocide, labor camps), so the mother's reaction is kinda understandable."
Review: Totally agree there. They definitely don’t teach roof repair at prince school
"Review: Wow, can’t believe I missed that. Well I guess that’ll be something to watch out for on my *next* rewatch (because I literally just finished a rewatch yesterday)"
Review: [removed]
"Review: >!Day of Black Sun is pretty straightforward in saying that Ursa was involved in Azulon's death as a way to spare Zuko's life. Some fans correctly guessed the exact cause of death, some didn't. !<  
 

>!I didn't mean to imply The Search was only or mainly about further explaining the assassination of Azulon and why Ursa was banished, simply that it is one of the things it did. Certainly I didn't mean to imply I dislike The Search, I love it. I was just saying that I don't think its a flaw of the show that it didn't go more in depth on some of these topics.!<"
Review: Done.
"Review: The Storm and The Blue Spirit from Book 1 are fantastic episodes too, specially how they develop Zuko's character"
Review: [removed]
"Review: I disagree that he is the protagonist - he's pretty clearly a deuteragonist (which was very successfully done). Zuko's arc is far more compelling than Aang's though. I do love Aang's story and all, but I think because I'm older I prefer more complex and darker characters. Without Zuko ATLA would be a lot harder to watch as an adult."
"Review: Zuko is literally the only reason (apart from Sokka's comical sense of humor) that I rewatched ATLA. He is 100% the best character, without a doubt.

And his best quote?

>""That's rough, buddy."""
Review: Aang lost his entire culture and people. It's just that neither the show and neither Aang focus on the huge drama of that tragedy as they could. But we can still see the pain in Aang in an episode such as The Storm
Review: [removed]
Review: It's Kyoshi so I'd be surprised if the weren't
"Review: I think he takes it to mean, in this episode, to remember to be a strong fire prince. From a wider perspective, as  viewers we can see it as more about his individual self"
Review: Agree
Review: There are also wanted posted hanging up with Zuko and Iroh on them.
"Review: I agree, but Book 2 overall has so much world building, such as those memories Zuko has during Zuko Alone, that Book 1 pales in comparison"
"Review: >!TBH, the Crystal Cave scene and the subsequent defection were planned all along. It was important for Zuko to finally come to a decision within himself and see that what he thought he always wanted isn't at all what he thought it would be. As he says to Mai in ""Nightmares and Daydreams"" ""During the meeting, I was the perfect prince. I was the son my father always wanted. But I wasn't me"", hinting that the war within himself continued to rage on, and were only partially quenched when he joined the Gaang.!<"
"Review: You are underrating the tragedy and pain of Aang's arc. You are also forgetting Iroh and, above all, the main Gaang: Aang, Katara, Sokka and Toph. Zuko is probably the pinnacle of the show's writing, but the Gaang is still great and their compelling friendship, arcs and bonds are still great in their own right. The show is as fantastic as it is because of Zuko, Iroh, Azula, the Gaang, Appa and Momo. The show would be a lot worse without the whole Gaang too. It also has great action and comedy too."
Review: You mention that it is rarely done successfully... do you have other examples in mind? I would like to explore if you have a list.
"Review: Book 2 is most of the bulk of Zuko's arc in the entire series, no doubt."
"Review: You seem to be making a lot of assumptions about how I perceive the other characters. I'm just saying Zuko's story was the most compelling for me and without it, I don't think I would be as invested in the show."
"Review: I think you misread. The person you’re responding to didn’t say that it’s rarely done successfully. 

One of the best examples I can think of is Jesse from Breaking Bad and El Camino."
"Review: Book two is definitely the strongest bulk of his ark but I’ve always believed that even though the entire show was about Aang, season 3 zuko was the protagonist"
Review: Of course the show wouldn't be as good without Zuko and he is probably the best character. But Avayar's greatness goes way beyond even him
Review: Ah you’re right I read too fast. Thank you for pointing it out.
Review: I agree that avatar is still good I just don’t think it would be as appealing as an adult.
