"Review: ""Look at Katara's hair, what's up with that?""

Nice going Aang"
"Review: This episode is such an underrated gem. Sokka is the backbone of the Gaang and is constantly pushing himself to be half as valuable as the others 'inherently' are as benders.

This episode is beautiful and sad and poignant. What does it feel like to be the worst at something? To be the weak link? (Even if you aren't) It is a tremendous weight to carry around for anyone, let alone a teenager. In this episode he finds the strength and value that he had all along-- and the group finds it too. He is not just Sokka: the meat and sarcasm guy, but, rather, the brilliant, creative, unique 'leader' and heart of this group. Plus the space sword is dope as hell."
Review: Aang in that suit of armor is one of the funniest scenes in the show.  It’s cute little Aang in this outrageous outfit for battle with that heavy guitar music playing in the background.  Then if that wasn’t enough you’ve got him making the sound effects of a wind sword before he promptly falls over.  It’s funny and sweet and exactly the kind of humor that made ATLA so popular.
"Review: ""Good use of terrain, fighting from the high ground.""

Obi wan would be proud"
"Review: ""I don't know. They missed you or something. I didn't care.""

Toph tsundere confirmed?"
"Review: First timer here.

* Again, [look at how Toph gets concerned](https://i.imgur.com/HxZRg3W.png) only after the meteor lands, when she is able to feel it. The little things matter.
* Oh my god, [swole Iroh](https://i.imgur.com/DpCHFnL.png) is the character I never knew I wanted. It hasn't been that long since he was captured in Ba Sing Se, has it? The prison diet must do wonders for him. It also made me a little ashamed of my fitness regimen during the quarantine.
* ""Who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time?"" I know Toph deserves praise, but not right now Aang.
* [Not the greatest choice of apparel](https://i.imgur.com/sYPrml1.png) when your skills require you to move your body effectively. It does get all the badass points though, which might just make it worth it.
* So Toph learned earth-bending from the badger moles. How did that even work? Did she feel the vibrations when they earth-bent?
* if anyone would find a master in the Fire Nation, I didn't think it would be Sokka. Not that you would see me complaining.
* [That expression of pure bewilderment](https://i.imgur.com/wcXeU1n.png). I liked how they built upon Sokka's creative skills as well rather than only making him ""better"" at sword-fighting. And say what you may, he is determined to better himself. Who else would painstakingly make a sword out of meteorite?
* Sokka's training was probably one of the shortest ones we've seen until now. Which kinda makes sense considering the strict deadline they're under. At least he got initiated into the Order of the White Lotus. This was yet another example that I think points to its members being tribe-agnostic.
* This episode was so long overdue. From the episode in which the gaang broke into the Ba Sing Se palace, Sokka seemed outclassed in almost every fight. I love smart and resourceful Sokka, and I'm so excited to see what he does with his sword and fresh new skills."
"Review: This is one of my favorite episodes of the whole series, love the character arc that Sokka has, I love how Piandao knew all the time about the Avatar and Sokka being not from the fire nation, but still teaching him.

Many people often say that this episode is unnecessary, but for me, it is the culmination of Sokka's character arc, which was never elaborated on in this way in previous episodes. It also shows how the group is so established and united that when someone is missing (Sokka) his absence is really noticeable."
"Review: I really like the subtle jabs the writers take at some of the criticisms of this show through jokes in this episode. Some people don’t like how goofy sokka is, the gaang being bored without sokka is the writers saying “look how boring this show would be without sokka”. Another one is how some people dont like how the character designs are a little simplistic so they put aang in this ridiculously over designed costume and show how while it may look nicer, aang cant move at all. Simpler designs allow for more fluid animation. 

Also I know a lot of people say the last two episodes feel like they’re just filler (and i do agree this season has pacing issues) but i hope now people can at least see what the writers were trying to do, they’re giving the characters their own episodes.
The headband was centered around aang.
Painted lady was kataras.
This is one is obviously sokkas but the the difference this time is this one had actual character development for the character it focused on.

>!The next one is on the fire nation antagonists but its mainly zukos and as always he steals the show because imo “the beach” is the best out of all these character centric episodes. We get tophs episode later on in the runaway and seeing as how she wasn’t introduced until a couple episodes into season 2 it even makes sense to delay hers and have the four original main characters go first. The writers perfect these episodic character driven episodes in the second half of this season with the “zuko field trip” episodes and use them as a way to really establish a relationship between zuko and each of the members of the gaang (minus toph, rip) before the finale. This is why season 3 is the best!!<"
Review: [deleted]
"Review: This is my second time re-watching the series (after watching it when it first aired). Here are my thoughts:

---""Sokka's Master"" is truly one of my favorite episodes from this season. This episode solidifies Sokka's unmatchable warrior heart and honor. It also depicts how essential Sokka is to the gaang. 


---At the beginning of this episode, Sokka really believes he isn't special because he can't bend any element. We can't blame him for feeling this way because anyone in his position in the gaang would feel the same. Although the gaang knows Sokka is truly special, and no one sees him as just a regular guy, as Katara so lovingly reminds him, it is time for Sokka's to have his own journey. 


---It is Sokka's honesty that Piandao is attracted to. It's what makes him decide Sokka is truly worthy of training. 


---It is Sokka's heart of a warrior that Piandao observes in training, and that ultimately earns him his well deserved respect. 


---I just noticed Piandao's training arena floor has a giant white lotus tile. 


---Aang: ""Say something funny""
Sokka: ""Funny how?""
Am I the only one that cracks up laughing on this part?

---Seeing Sokka forge his own sword from raw materials is the most badass and inspirational part of this episode. Like Piandao says, ""I wouldn't have it any other way.""


---Sokka admitting he lied about his identity and proudly proclaiming he is from the Southern Water Tribe is what defines him. He will always be proud of who he is, and he will always remain true to himself no matter where he is. 


---The sword battle is just epic. And I love how Sokka can still be a goofball and a warrior at the same time even in the middle of a presumably life-threatening battle. 


---Sokka is the warrior spirit of the gaang. Without him there is no gaang. 


---Lastly, Buff Uncle Iroh for President!"
"Review: This is one of my favorite episodes because it highlights my boy Sokka! His struggles and feelings of unworthiness seem more relatable than any other character to me. This episode also demonstrated how integral Sokka was to the group morale, and I loved seeing Katara, Aang, and Toph’s POV while Sokka is training. Creating the sword was out of a meteor was literally the most Sokka thing to do, and it really was a physical symbol of his creativity, growth, and leadership since book 1. I love Sokka so much!!!"
Review: Iroh's prison bod improvement has me quaking.
Review: I love Sokka’s expressions as he’s trying to explain how his name is common in the fire nation colonies. It worries me that the live action series will end up looking like the Lion King 2019 but my expectations are high.
"Review: -Robert Patrick - voice actor of Piandou did an amazing job, my favorite line was: I think I'm a little too old to be fighting the avatar.
Reminds me of AL Pachino."
Review: Does Katara's comment at the end confirm that the planet they're on is named Earth?
"Review: Love this episode cuz it gives Sokka the respect he deserves.


I always liked Piandao's design. He's a good looking guy.


Also, I never noticed how Sokka loves shopping, a typically ""girly"" trait. That's a nice change."
"Review: Watching this episode this time around, I noticed how differently Sokka approaches his training compared to the other members of the gaang. He is so humble and gracious compared to the entitled and impatient ways that Katara and Aang approach their training, and that is really refreshing to me. It's also one of the reasons Sokka is my favorite character! Definitely one of my favorite episodes."
"Review: Any thoughts of the significance of Sokka's sword being crafted from material from space? Perhaps a gift from his celestial ex-girlfriend?

There does seem to be a theme of Sokka having a  relationship with the ""otherwordly"" aspects of the universe, outside of the four elements. Both supernatural (Yue and the moon, he's the only main character to spend time in the spirit world during the course of the show besides Aang), and in science (shows a knack for science at the Air Temple, his idea to use the eclipse to their advantage, sword made from space material). Maybe that is the show's way of making for Sokka not being able to bend any of the classic elements."
"Review: Something that really bugs me rewatching the show is that Greg Baldwin’s Iroh sticks out like a sore thumb to me. 

It’s not through any fault of his own-he did the best impression he could-but Mako’s Iroh had such a distinct timbre to his voice that no impression I’ve heard has recaptured. It’s one of the few aspects of the show I actively dislike when I watch it through."
"Review: This episode called me out for not working out during quarantine as much as I should. Sorry Iroh. 

I honestly think this is one of the better episodes of the series. The writing is beautiful, Sokka’s an amazing character that often overlooked in favor of his traveling companions, and it deals with really apt themes. Sometimes I wonder if the gaang really realizes how much they need their friendly meat and sarcasm guy in order to function. He's the glue keeping them together—he's always the one keeping them focused and safe, but is also the first to lighten the mood and keep them laughing. Aang and Katara wouldn't have made it past the first iceberg without him. Its nice to see him get some credit for once.

>!Super off topic note: So Piandao trained Zuko, right? Can we just imagine little Zuko running around doing these tasks or making a sword for a sec? He probably took forever doing everything because he was so determined to get it right!<"
"Review: lol i just watched this ep by chance

&#x200B;

also 

&#x200B;

AANG: ""Sokka! Stand clear!""

SOKKA:""Right, stand clear.""

\*sokka gets attacked by giant wave bc he was salty\*"
"Review: Misplaced episode. Should be in book 1 or early book 2. It doesn't make sense that Sokka's insecurities about not being useful in the team resurface after all the times he came up with the plans, held his own in battles and also met his father who reassured him that he was a true warrior. The premise just comes out of nowhere. Other than that, it's pretty nice to see a non-bender be respected as a genuine master and more White Lotus hints are always welcome."
"Review: This episode always felt kind of unnecessary.

Sokka had already established himself as an incredibly valuable member of the Gaang. There are dozens of examples of him being the ""plan guy"" and the show makes it clear that the team would not get far without him. He doesn't need to be a great warrior to validate his worth.

>!And frankly, there's not a lot of payoff to the training. There's that one moment in DoBS, but that doesn't seem like something he wasn't capable of before. !<

Tbh I really dislike the slow-paced ""hangout vibe"" of the first half of Book 3. It's not that all the episodes are bad, but there are so many more interesting things the show could be exploring given the limited amount of time remaining."
Review: Seeing Sokka not being able to do anything in the beginning of the episode always makes me a bit sad.
"Review: This is the most underrated episode in my opinion is in my top 3, the fight scenes, Sokka's development the white lotus forshadowing It is my favorite episode besides the final of season 2 and 3 because Sokka develops both in ""swordbending"" and as a person. Also Master Piandao's speech at the end is one of my favorites and in a sense is conected to the Avatrñar and Iroh's comment about the four nations"
"Review: So much character progression in one episode! Sokka has grown before, but this I believe is easily the most growth that I see in an episode. It’s literally a 22 minute training montage for Sokka on his journey to wielding a sword. It’s exciting to see how he held his own by the end of the episode."
Review: Zuko and Sokka both were taught by Piandao!
"Review: I loved this episode, and actually identified with Sokka. Feeling like the weakest link, like the dumb one. 

I love that they weren't just BSing him to make him feel better when they told him he was the best at making plans, reading maps, and even making jokes. When he wasn't there, they actually struggled with that. 

I love the message of this. That you shouldn't feel worthless, but at the same time, you should always strive to improve yourself. Sokka became a better swordsman, but he wasn't suddenly useful just because he got a cool new sword. He was always a contributing member in the Gaang. 

I love that his sword duel shows how creative he is, thinking very quickly on his feet."
"Review: I like the twist where Piandao fights Sokka and the viewer thinks it's because he's from the Fire Nation, but it's actually a final test."
"Review: Iroh’s side story in this episode builds on his character (and his muscles) so beautifully; one of my favorite parts of the series. He looks like a goddamn hairless silverback by the end.

Also, he should be the patron saint of r/bodyweightfitness."
"Review: I just finished a marathon first watch of ATLA and LOK and I love the shows so much. So these are frwsh thoughts.

I loved this episode so much. Sokka often gets the short end of the stick, and it's absolutely heartbreaking when he finally admits that his inability to bend makes him feel inferior. It's clear he struggles with his self-esteem, and both this episode as well as the first episode with Jet make me so happy that Sokka can see and truly appreciate his worth. I felt so happy for Sokka when at the end Piandao, one of the Fire Nation's greatest swordsmen, was so proud to call him his pupil."
Review: Sokka’s freaking out about the schedule in the last episode feels like a misfire. It’s strange that he goes from panicking about this apparently super time-crunched plan to wanting to take the time to train. How long was he expecting his training to take?
"Review: Loved this episode. Seeing the gaang sit around, bored, when Sokka was away was really funny to me. But it also made me realize how vital to the mission Sokka is. Being able to keep spirits high is super important when you're traveling for months on end, with the responsibility of saving the world. Imagine how mentally hard it would be without him. And having a sword forged from a meteorite is just plain awesome. 


Also Iroh is ripped."
Review: So much for Sokka’s grand schedule.
"Review: Aang: Say Something Funny!

Sokka: ""Funn-""

Random Joe pesci: ""-y how?"
"Review: This was my favorite episode, always wanted sokka to do something cool"
Review: Master Piandao looks very much like Sifu Kisu. Do we know if the character was based on him?
"Review: [Sokka's Master](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/lb_i.php?lb_id=13083663820B12460100&i_id=13135533630I85659800&p=47) - this episode continues the trend of time-wasting until the invasion, Yaaayyy.... And because the audience already knows that Sokka isn't useless, and the Gaang already knows Sokka isn't useless (but for the sake of the plot they conveniently forgot here), I guess we needed an episode Sokka learns that he isn't useless for some contrived reason... by someone else telling him he's not useless. 

> Katara takes one look at this and says, ""The fire is gonna destroy that town.""

>> Um, Katara, this is the Fire Nation. Odds are, they have firebenders in that town; I'm pretty sure they can handle it. And even that assumes that the fire will be able to sustain itself to any degree on the short grass between itself and the town.

It shit like this that reminded me of the movie that shan't be named and the way it approached dealing with Firebending. Basically, the firebenders for some reason could not bend without an established outside source for their flames. So their had to a fire place, or pyre, or something that was on fire in order for a firebender to do their thing. Which is so damn stupid. Part of the cool about the Avatar bending system was that 2 elements needed a source and 2 didn't, it gave it a sense of balance. But apparently not the case for the movie, and what made it dumber was that movie-Iroh ruins all this by Firebending without a source anyway, and somehow all who witness this are absolutely shocked... 

Anyway, my point is that I was always curious about what Firebenders do when there is a natural wildfire, can they control it? Or can they only generate their own flames?

> Toph says that she misses the hero worship now that they have to go around incognito. Which sounds nice and all...

>> Until you realize that it makes no sense coming out of Toph's mouth! What hero worship did she even experience? Sure, there was plenty of hero worship in Season 1, but she wasn't around then. In Season 2, the Gaang got a bit of hero worship from the pregnant couple, but their defeat of the Drill was followed by the introduction of the Dai Li. Maybe they got a bit from the Earth King, but that's about it. So what in the hell is she talking about?

Maybe Aaron Ehasz knows.../s

> On the commentary for this section, Brian Konietzko (one of the co-creators of the series) said, [""Everything that Aang is wearing represents stylistic elements that Mike and I don't really care for.""](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/S3E04_9112.jpg) Um, OK. But why is it here? You're not really poking fun at it. And the references are so muddled and incomprehensible that it's impossible to even know what these stylistic elements actually are. You can't just put a bunch of stuff into a blender, plop it onto the screen, and expect us to know what the hell you're talking about. And it certainly doesn't amount to satire or mockery.

Not gonna lie, when I was a kid I was a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors and had owned 3 & 5XL. So I felt like I knew what this was referencing, but years have passed since and now I can't really say I do what's being referenced here. So maybe someone can help me out here? Someone at the end of the review says it supposed to reference JRPGs and a few Anime, but like, which Anime? Who the fuck actually dresses like this? I *guess* some Final Fantasy characters dress this way? W.O.L definitely comes to mind when I think of his depiction in Dissidia, but that's it really.

> **Down the Rabbit Hole**

Even though I agree, I don't much care for Piandao being a Gary Stu tbh. He's not really all that interesting as a character going by his history. I think it's cool that he's based on Sifu Kisu, but I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't cool how they didn't make another character for Sifu [Manny](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Manuel_Rodriguez) considering what he helped bring to the table. So overall, he's a very meh character. But hey, I guess the kiddies needed **another** reminder that ""not all Fire Nation folk are evil"" :/

This episode as a whole is pretty meh for me as well. The only thing of interest is the fact that Sokka's sword is made of meteorite. Oh, and Iroh gettin swole!"
Review: Nice to see how quickly Aang's earthbending is progressing with how easily he can dig himself into holes.
Review: I saw someone point out that it's her first time forgoing the hair loopies  which explains why she reacted so quickly to a comment about it
"Review: As evident from ""Avatar Day"" and ""The Cave of Two Lovers"", our Aang isn't exactly one of the best speakers."
Review: At least he didn't say he'd rather kiss her than die?
"Review: It would have been so easy for the show to have demoted him to a secondary character, a comic relief. But they didn't for which I'm very glad."
"Review: The whole ""3 on 3 plus Sokka"" becomes a lot less funnier when watching this episode."
"Review: ""In the commentary for ""Sokka's Master"", the creators stated that the armor is a parody of certain styles and fictional characters that they are not fond of yet are sometimes asked to incorporate into *Avatar* in order to make the series ""cooler"". ""

Gotta love the creators for sticking it to them critics."
Review: Iron Maang.
Review: [deleted]
"Review: When I rewatched it, I had no one in the room to reference that too *tear*"
Review: Just as headstrong as the earth she bends.
Review: Yeah her progression of opening up to the gaang becomes more evident I believe this sesson. But I think this is more toward her crush on Sokka since the Serpent’s Pass
Review: Earth-Baka?
"Review: Sokka did not get initiated into the White Lotus, actually the Gang still have no clue what the White Lotus tile that Piandao gives them means at the end of the episode. “What is it Sokka” “Its a pai sho tile” “What does it mean?” “I don’t know”"
"Review: I think because the badger moles were blind, Toph was able to better understand their movements. I have a feeling that Toph was already earthbending before her encounter with them (kind of like the body's natural way of adapting to physical limitations) and had some vibration sense already. But learning from the badger moles just sort of boosted her learning, as they were the only blind teachers that she could learn very niche techniques from."
"Review: I like how this episode highlights that Sokka’s really more of an idea guy. He’s the kind of person you’d want to have your back in a fight not because he’d beat the daylights out of them (like Toph) or try to talk them down (like Aang). No, you want Sokka on your side because he’ll come up with some crazy plan that actually works, and if it doesn’t he’s now got some cool sword skills as a backup."
Review: just swole Iroh is enough to make the whole episode

"Review: >Not the greatest choice of apparel

> when your skills require you to move your body effectively. It does get all the badass points though,

r/mallninjashit"
"Review: I’d never considered that early season 3 emphasized the characters in this way but you’re right. Its a really nice way of highlighting who these characters at heart—Aang’s a goofball, Katara wants to help the world, so on and so forth."
"Review: “It wasn’t your skills that impressed me. No, it certainly wasn’t your skills.” I love these lines because 1) they’re unexpectedly funny and 2) they show that Sokka didn’t gain his sense of worth from being anything but himself. 
As worthless as he felt compared to the rest of the Gaang, he earns his sense of self-worth just by being true to who he is: a protector, a thinker, a man with honor and integrity."
"Review: Speaking of Iroh for President, there’s a drawing in the new Legacy of the Fire Nation comic that shows what Iroh would have looked like had he become the Fire Lord as the oldest son tradition dictates. In a letter to Zuko, Iroh says that Ozai becoming Fire Lord instead of him made him feel  so ashamed of himself, since growing up as crown prince it was always something he (Iroh) knew to expect for himself one day, a title he looked forward to inheriting. However, he is happy that fate had other plans for him, and tells Zuko that one may never know what plans fate has for anyone."
"Review: Yeah he's in his room working out like a mad mofo, while I'm sitting in my room eating one too many slices of pizza and binge-watching Avatar."
"Review: The first 5ish episodes of book 3 are probably my favorites of the series, so much character development, the best time that the show could be Slice of life and get away with it imo"
Review: Yup. The colonel did a great job.
"Review: Considering one of the forms of bending is “earthbending”, I’m gonna go with yes, it is a planet called earth"
"Review: Mako’s accent and speech patterns can be imitated, but the full emotional range of his acting ability gets lost. It can’t be helped but Iroh becomes a less dynamic character after his death."
Review: This stuck out to me immediately when I first watched the show a week or two ago.
"Review: I don’t recall Iroh having any lines in this episode, just grunting...am I missing something?"
Review: Agreed. I don't think I really noticed as a kid watching the original airing - but it's like night and day on the rewatch.
"Review: I don't recall Iroh having any actual lines in this episode? Just grunting while he gets swole

Edit: nvm I see someone else already said the exact same thing and you answered them. Ignore this, kind person"
Review: Which I feel is a subtle reference to the fortune teller saying his life would be filled with a lot of unlucky occurences.
"Review: I take it as he is about to be part of a fight with the fire lord during the comet, he’s been fine up until this point with what he knows but I think he realizes he’s gonna need to really bring it if he wants to be helpful during the final battles."
"Review: Book 3 is in such a weird place, altogether. Sometimes it feels like all it does is tie loose end after loose end. Of course there's the beach episode. And the catchup episode... eh.

Actually, I can completely understand why. In Book 3 they *sort of* have some time to calm down, as in things are *sort of* settled and they have to wait for things to happen, without rushing to prepare everything. When you've been stressed out and rushing for a long period of time and it ends and you're left with long periods of time with nothing but your thoughts for company, your brain starts to process all that stress. 

I seem to remember Sokka having a few throwaway lines every now and then about being the odd man out, so it's not like this comes out of *absolutely* nowhere. Besides, it's a weekly show, *everything* comes out of nowhere. It's not like the Great Ravine was foretold several episodes in advance."
"Review: I think it’s reasonable that he still doubts himself, yes he has had his moments throughout the series but there have also been plenty of times hes been sidelined and even mocked by toph. The opening scene is to remind the audience of this. The reason i think this episode is titled “sokkas master” is because of how unique his relationship with his master is compared to the rest if the gaang. Their masters taught them how to be great, sokkas master taught him that he was already great."
"Review: My thoughts exactly. In a vacuum, this episode has plenty of great things going for it but it doesn't fit with Sokka's previous experience and characterization. The beginning with the meteor feels especially forced since if this were any other episode Sokka would have been the one to come up with the plans for stopping the fire.

Plus, Sokka is arguably more important now than ever before as he basically planned out the invasion himself and is responsible for getting everyone to the rendezvous on time."
"Review: i respectfully disagree, these kinds of episodes are important in ensemble shows. Yes we have seen sokken being useful, but its been a theme throughout that sokken feels less worthy in the group when everyone ia doing their bending, while also doubting his skills as a warrior (even though hes always been a good one). This episode doesnt just reaffirm him as a good warrior and teammate, but also gives him the master-pupil connection all the others have, including toch with the badgermoles.

Besides that im happy so much of season 3 is hangout vibe, the show is about defeating the big baddie sure, but so much of the show is just the amazing characters being themselves, and exploring who they are. One of my top 3  episodes, tales of ba sing se, does nothing to move the plot but thats what makes it a good episode. The stakes are relatively low, but you get to see the traits of each character so well. This master episode does that for sokka, who got the least impressive tale of ba sing se segment."
"Review: I 100% agree with the pacing. I wish they >!moved up the invasion episodes earlier in the season, and moved some episodes like this one to the second half. This also means more episodes with Zuko and the Gaang which I really like.!< Going from the long arc from The Library to Crossroads in season 2 to more episodic, contained storylines was noticeably jarring on my rewatch."
"Review: Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. The general excuse is that Sokka needed this so he realizes how valuable he is, but all this episode does is have someone else tell him how valuable he is instead of, y'know, him realizing it himself."
"Review: Yeah, Aang says “look after Momo”, and then Momo ends up putting out more small fires than Sokka."
Review: Wait really?
"Review: >Not gonna lie, when I was a kid I was a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors and had owned 3 & 5XL.

Someone in Nickelodeon pressured Bryke to give cool armor and an ""Airbending Sword"" to sell toys. The whole scene is a middle finger to Nickelodeon (seriously fuck Nickelodeon). 

And for your other question, [Mako claimed an explosion in LoK.](https://gfycat.com/sillycooperativebluemorphobutterfly-firebending-mako)"
Review: You just read that boy for filth and I LOVED it.
Review: THOSE ARE YOUR HAIR LOOPIES!
Review: Which is ridiculous seeing as how he had one of the smoothest plays in only two episodes ago😡
"Review: But also?? they manage to keep in his gleeful nature. Like there are straight up TWO fades to black with Sokka’s face breaking into a wide grin. 

Also, his delight in shopping is just so refreshing. Albeit, the show pokes at people deviating from gender norms (“you’re the one whose purse needs to match his belt”), this moment Katara truly knows her bro and unironically suggests they take him shopping. It’s just so wholesome and not played as a cheap joke and it just shows how the show matured over time."
"Review: I think it was also because Nickelodeon wanted toys of Aang in armour, which they thought would sell more, but the creators never liked giving Aang armour so that scene was meant as a joke about that."
Review: where can i see the commentary?
Review: I don't like pebbles. They're coarse and rough and irritating and get everywhere.
"Review: I argue it's a clue for when he gets older.


So not yet a initiation, but more a key to the clubhouse should he choose to join."
"Review: Yeah, afaik the gang has never heard of the white lotus before this point and we only know about it from the scenes with Iroh and Zuko

this scene was probably meant to be a tip-off more to the audience that piandao was White Lotus, though it's also about time that the gang start being clued into its existence"
"Review: I know. Just kidding.

I wonder if the tile will remain a memorable token, or will it be useful to the gaang in the future."
"Review: Sokka is already a great fighter with sword-ish weapons, the training seemed like it was mostly him adjusting to the use of an actual sword and internalizing the philosophy of it. And even the philosophy is something he already has pre-training, just not a firm enough grasp yet.

This was Sokka learning of the path before him and taking the first few steps with the help of his master. There's still a long way to go, but he's on the right course now."
"Review: The word ""earth"" can mean dirt, rocks, soil, etc. That's why that bending style is named the way it is. It doesn't necessarily mean that the planet they're on is called Earth; after all, most of the surface seems to be covered in water. It makes sense for a rock from a meteorite to be called earth, but *my* point was that Katara thought it shouldn't be called that because it's ""from space""; in other words, ""not from this planet"". Why should it not be called earth if it's not from the planet? Because that planet is called Earth as well. That's why we don't refer to meteorites as earth in real life either."
Review: Lmao
"Review: I agree wholeheartedly. The two main things that simply couldn’t be replicated were Mako’s emotional acting and the basic sound of his voice. Baldwin was obviously caught between a rock an a hard place-he tried to imitate Mako’s accent and tone, which stifled his ability to act. And he simply couldn’t *sound* like Mako, just by the nature of the human voice."
"Review: You're not wrong. When I wrote this I probably just picked an episode where I knew Iroh was in prison.

&#x200B;

Because of the timing of Mako's death, Greg Baldwin had to fill in some missing lines from Book 2 (e.g. Tales of Ba Sing Se); but since the bulk of Iroh's lines were still Mako, the character didn't feel any different.

&#x200B;

By the time Book 3 came out, all of Iroh's dialogue was Baldwin. Without Mako's voice present at all, the pretense fell apart for me. It becomes an obvious, grating imitation of a singularly idiosyncratic voice.

&#x200B;

I know that I'm overly critical of the swap, and to most people it's a non-factor. But it's the truth of my experience watching the show."
"Review: > it's a weekly show, everything comes out of nowhere

This exactly is my one real problem with the show, it can feel a bit disjointed, as well as inconsistent. I guess the creators were by necessity going for something like the episodic world- and character-building of Cowboy Bebop and such, but avoiding elaborate plotting and lore-building just doesn't work well for a grand heroic fantasy adventure."
"Review: >!Maybe this episode would have worked better right after the eclipse, when Sokka's plan caused much of their group to be captured? Or even a couple episodes after it, after Zuko joins the gang, and we could have had a cool Zuko-Piandao reunion. I guess Sokka's guilt is resolved in the Boiling Rock episodes though.!<"
"Review: Agreed with you up until that last sentence. Sokka’s Vignette is easily better than aangs and katana-tophs, and debatably better than zuko and momos"
"Review: keep in mind ATLA wasnt meant to be binge watched on a streaming service, so episodes are generally more self contained, and those multi episode stories would often be marathoned by nickelodeon, sometimes being special events on the channel"
"Review: Yep, in a comic Zuko mentions that he was taught by Piandao."
"Review: Wow. Thanks for the explanation, and yeah Fuck Nickelodeon.

And I can't believe I forgot this. So thanks again! :3"
"Review: > Um, Katara, this is the Fire Nation. Odds are, they have firebenders in that town; I'm pretty sure they can handle it. And even that assumes that the fire will be able to sustain itself to any degree on the short grass between itself and the town.

I mean, the previous village didn't seem to have any firebenders at all. Also, I don't think it would be in their personalities to just let a fire burn until someone else comes to fix it."
Review: Aang wins some aang loses some
"Review: Aang’s an airbender. The Air Nomads have never needed armor, they don’t have an army! Plus, it was probably just hinder the practice of airbending as it relies on being light!"
Review: Such typical exec stuff. Totally not getting who the character is.
Review: The absurd description of the air sword makes a lot more sense with all these behind-the-scenes facts in mind.
Review: blu-ray bonus features
"Review: Yeah, I’m with you. On my first watch, even though I knew about the change I couldn’t really tell the difference. But on the rewatch I just did,  I could definitely tell.

Baldwin’s voice isn’t bad by any means, it just feels like its missing something. I will say that I think its a bit better in his appearances in Korra though."
Review: That's an absolutely awesome idea  and a clear missed opportunity.
Review: When did Zuko and Piandao meet?
"Review: I mean its funny and cute but unlike the other vignettes its pure comedic relief, and doesn't expand upon the character of sokka, we know he's funny and quick witted. I'd say momos is actually one of the better ones, it serves to realise mono to a true character, its on par with appas lost days in that respect, and it makes ATLA a better show, because tbe animals aren't just cute and funny, they're real beings. That's what makes monos vignette so special. Is say sokkas and aangs are the worst, and katara and zuko are really good too imo, since they give zuko some more humanisation, and katara and tophs serves to establish the sister like bond theyre growing into, which is further established in the runaway >!when toph asks katara to help her write a letter to her parents!<"
"Review: A lot of new shows that come out in the streaming age are pretty much long, drawn out movies in their plots. They get a set amount of episodes with set time sets per episode and know itll be watched in a binge fashion, so the writers plan it out based on that"
Review: That’s awesome
"Review: It'd be pretty neat if there were some throwaway text explaining all firebenders are quickly conscripted.

I don't remember anything like that, though."
"Review: >  they don’t have an army!

Well, I don't know how you could possibly know more than our national history book. Unless you were there a hundred years ago."
Review: I think it was mentioned in the comics (lost adventures) that Piandao also trained Zuko in swords.
"Review: They never say anything like that, but that's an interesting theory. If I remember correctly the only civilian we see firebending during the whole season is that school bully from ""The Headband"" and I assume that the Fire Nation would have a minimum age requirement before they can be conscripted."
